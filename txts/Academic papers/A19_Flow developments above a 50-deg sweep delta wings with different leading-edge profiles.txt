The characteristics  of flow  developments above 50-deg sweep delta wings with different leading-edge profiles
are shown by flow visualizations and velocity measurements.  The Reynolds number based on freestream velocity
and root chord is about 7  x  103. The leading-edge profiles studied include the shapes of square,  round, windward
surface  beveling,  leeward surface  beveling, and  wedge.  Based  on  the  velocity data  obtained  along the  leading
edges of the delta wings it is noted that the flow  angles associated  with the separated  shear  layers vary with the
leading-edge  profiles  studied.  This  finding  infers  that  varying the  leading-edge  profile  has  an  impact  on  the
initial  development  of the separated  shear  layer, consequently,  the formation of  leading-edge  vortex.  Further-
more,  it  is  shown  that  the  leading  edge  of  windward beveling causes  the  largest  leading-edge  flow  angle  and
produces  the most  organized  leading-edge vortex.
Introduction
D ELTA  wing models  employed  for  experimental  studies
are  frequently  characterized  by sharp  leading-edge pro-
files.  Accumulation of  experimental evidence  shows that  the
characteristics of  the  leading-edge vortex  flow  above  a sharp
leading-edge delta wing persist over a wide range of Reynolds
numbers.  This  phenomenon  can  be  perceived  from  the  fact
that  a  delta  wing at  an  angle  of  attack  forces  the  windward
flow  to  separate  at  the  leading edge,  therefore,  the  location
of  flow  separation  that  causes vortex  formation is insensitive
to  the  Reynolds  number.  Further,  there  seems  a  consensus
among  the  experimentalists  that  as  long  as  the  leading-edge
profiles  are  sharp,  the  leading-edge  profile  is  not  of  critical
concern.  This  can be  sensed  from  a review over the previous
reports  that  no  statement  regarding a standard  configuration
of  the  leading-edge  profile has  been  proposed.  Table  1 pre-
sents a collection of the delta wing models described.1"26 While
most of the delta wing models  reported adopt a configuration
of  the  leading-edge  beveling  on  the  windward  surface,  the
beveling angles, and thickness ratios, i.e., the thickness of the
wing model vs the root chord  length, are  not  unified.  Among
the references shown in Table 1, few reports except Kegelman
and  Roos21  studied  the  impacts  of  the  leading-edge  profile
and the thickness ratio on the vortex flow  development above
the  delta  wings. Kegelman  and  Roos21  performed  flow  visu-
alization  and  force  measurements  of  the  70-deg  sweep  delta
wings  with  nine  leading-edge  profiles.  They  found  that  dif-
ferent   leading-edge   profiles   significantly  affect   the   vortex
breakdown  location.
This study is concerned  with flow developments above delta
wing models of the same thickness, but with different  leading-
edge  profiles.  The  experimental  results  obtained   show  that

the  leading-edge  profiles  have  significant   influence  on   the
developments  of  vortex  flow.
Experimental Methods
Experiments were performed in a closed-return water chan-
nel.  The  maximum speed  attained  in  the  test  section,  60  x
60  cm  in  cross  section,  is  40  cm/s.  In  the  present  study,  the
freestream  velocity in the test section  denoted  as  U() was cho-
sen to  be 5 cm/s, at which both the  flow  visualization and the
velocity measurements above  the delta wing were performed.
A  survey over  the  flowfield   in  the  test  section  using  a  hot-
film  probe  indicated  that  the  nonuniformity of  the  velocity
distribution in the test section  away from  the boundary layers
of  the  test  section  walls, in  terms  of  the  difference  between
the  maximum  and  minimum  velocities  measured,   was  less
than  2%  and  the  turbulence  intensity measured  was  below
0.9%.
All of the delta wing models employed  have the root chord
lengths  of  12 cm,  and  identical  sweep  angles,  50 deg.  Based
on  the root  chord  length and the  freestream velocity chosen,
the  Reynolds number is about  7  x   103. At  a  =  10 deg,  i.e.,
the  angle of  attack  frequently chosen in the  work, the  block-
age  ratio  due  to  the  presence  of  the  delta  wing model  is less
than  1%.
The  delta wing models  employed  are characterized  by nine
leading-edge  profiles  shown  in  Fig.  1,  namely square,  wind-
ward  beveling at  25  deg,  round,  leeward  beveling at  15,  25,
35,  45,  and  60  deg,  respectively,  and  a  wedge  with  50-deg
included  angle.  The  delta  wing model  in the  test  section  was

Flow  Visualization
Delta   Wing
Fig.  2    Two coordinate systems employed in this study.
supported  by  a  sting  extended  from   the  rear,  which  was  a
circular  cylinder  3  mm  in  diameter.  The  delta  wing  models
were  made  of  aluminum  plates,  5  mm  in  thickness,  corre-
sponding to  4%  of  the  root  chord  length.
Two techniques of flow visualization were employed for the
present  work.  One  was to  introduce  the  color  dye  from  the
apex  of  the  delta  wing for  the  purpose  of  revealing  the  core
of  the leading-edge vortex. The  dye was introduced by either
a stainless-steel tube, 1 mm in diameter, attached beneath the
wing model,  or  the  tube placed upstream of the  wing model.
The other technique was to apply paint in dots on the leeward
surface  of the delta wing.27 Having the delta wing model placed
in the test section for a certain length of time, the dots become
traces due  to  the  viscous drag  of  flow  near  the  wing  surface.
The traces are noted equivalent to the limiting streamlines on
a  solid  surface.28
Velocity  measurements  of  the  flowfield  were  made  with  a
two-component laser velocimeter. The velocity data obtained
were  reduced  to  the  mean  velocity components in the X  and
Ydirections shown in Fig. 2, denoted as U and V, respectively.
It  should  be  mentioned  that  in  this  article  two  coordinate
systems  are  employed  for  the  convenience  of  later  descrip-
tions.  As seen  in Fig.  2, X,  Y,  and Z  denote the  axes of the
laboratory coordinate system, and x,y, and z denote the axes
of the coordinate system adhered to the delta wing. The  mean
velocity component in the Z  direction is denoted as W in this
work.
Delta  Wing  with  Square  Leading-Edge  Profile
The  results of flow  visualization obtained for the delta wing
with  square  leading-edge  profile,  at  a   =   10 deg,  are  shown
in  Fig.  3,  which  serve  as  a  basis  for  later  comparison.  The
dye  streaks  shown  in  the  photograph  in  Fig.  3a  indicate  the
cores  of  the  leading-edge  vortices.  As  a  counterpart  of  Fig.
3a,  the  limiting  streamline  pattern  shown  in  Fig.  3b  reveals
that  two  separation  lines  are  formed  symmetrically  with  re-
spect  to  the root  chord,  where  the  separation  line  is seen  as
the  result  of convergence  of  the  traces.  The  separation  lines
are  referred  as  a  result  of  the  secondary  separation  on  the
delta wing, induced by the  leading-edge vortices of which the
vortex  cores  are  shown  in  Fig.  3a.  Also  noted  in  Fig.  3b  is
that  in  the  region  near  the  trailing  edge  of  the  delta  wing,
outboard  of each  of  the  separation lines, the  reversed  flow  is
seen.
It  should  be  mentioned  that  for  the  delta  wing  at  a   =  20
deg and above, the dye streaks released from  the apex diffuse
immediately  downstream,  implying  no  formation  of  leading-
edge  vortices  above  the  delta  wing.  As  an  example,  Fig.  3c
presents  the  limiting  streamline  pattern  obtained  at  a   =  25
deg,  in which  no  separation  lines such  as  seen  in Fig.  3b  are
found.  Instead, the surface pattern is characterized by reverse
flow  occurring in the  outboard  region  of the  delta  wing, par-
ticularly near the trailing edge, while forward  flow takes place
in  the  neighborhood  of  the  root  chord.
Delta  Wings  with  Leading  Edges  Beveling  on  the
Windward   Surface
Figure 4 presents the  flow  visualization photographs of the
delta wing with the leading-edge 25-deg beveling on the wind-
ward surface, at a  =  10 deg. In Fig. 4a, the dye streaks clearly
show  the  formation   of  vortex  cores  above  the  delta  wing.
Moreover,  Fig.  4b indicates that  the  separation  lines formed
on  the delta wing surface  persist  until the  trailing edge of  the
delta  wing,  compared  to  the  separation  lines  shown  in  Fig.
3b that appear to curve into a spiral structure near the trailing
edge. Hence, this comparison of Figs. 3b and 4b suggests that
in  the  latter  case  the  secondary  separation  induced  by  the
leading-edge  vortex  is much  more well-organized.

Delta  Wings  with  the  Leading-Edges  Beveling  on  the
Leeward  Surface
Figure 5 presents the  flow  visualization results of the delta
wing  with  the  leading-edge  60-deg  beveling  on  the  leeward
side, at a  =  10 deg, which indicate that the flow characteristics
bear  similarity  to  those  of  the  square  leading  edge  and  the
leading-edge beveling on the windward surface. However, for
the  cases  of  the  leading-edge  beveling  angles  lower  than  60
deg,  the  flow  developments  above  delta  wings  are  noted  to
be  very  different  from  the  foregoing  description.  These  dif-
ferences  are   highlightened  by  the   flow  visualization  results
shown  in  Figs.  6-8,  which  correspond  to  the  cases  of  the
leading-edge  profiles   15-,  25-,   and  35-deg  beveling  on  the
leeward  surface,  respectively.  Interesting  features  noted  are
summarized  as  follows.
1) At a  =  10 deg, the formation  of the leading-edge vortex
structure is inhibited  from  these delta wing models. The  dye-
streak  visualization  photographs  in  Figs.  6a,  7a,  and  8a  do
not  indicate  the  formation  of  vortex  core.  Furthermore,  the
limiting streamline patterns in Figs.  7b and  8b show that the
separation lines are formed  along the interception of the bev-
eling surface and the flat surface on the leeward side, whereas
the  limiting  streamline  pattern  in  Fig.  6b  suggests  that  flow
attachment  is  likely  to  occur  along  the  interception.  All  of
Figs.  6b,  7b,  and  8b  indicate  no  formation  of the  separation
lines  associated  with  the  leading-edge  vortex  development,
which  are  seen  in the  previous figures.
2) At a  =  15 deg, flows over these three delta wings regain
the  tendency to  form  the  leading-edge vortex structures.  For
the delta wings with the leading-edges 15- and 35-deg beveling
on the leeward surface,  this tendency is seen clearly from  the
dye-streak  patterns  and  the   limiting  streamline  patterns  in
Figs. 6c and 6d, and Figs.  8c and 8d. The  delta wing with the
leading-edge  25-deg  beveling  on  the  leeward  surface  corre-
sponds  to  the  least-favorable  case  toward  the  formation  of
the  leading-edge vortex  structure,  shown  in Figs.  7c and  7d.
Delta  Wing  with  the Round  Leading-Edge   Profile
Figure 9 presents the  flow  visualization  results of the  delta
wing with round leading edge, at a  = 10 deg. The photographs

shown  suggest  that  although  the  round  leading  edge  is  not
sharp  geometrically,  the  flow  development  above  the  delta
wing shows similarity to the cases of square leading-edge pro-
files,  except in the region near the  apex. The  dye-streak pho-
tograph shown in Fig. 9a indicates that the leading-edge vortex
develops  above  the  delta  wing  in  the  region  downstream  of
x/C  =  0.2.
Delta  Wing  with  the  Leading-Edge  in  Wedge  Shape
Figure 10 presents the  flow visualization results of the delta
wing  with  the  leading  edge  in  wedge  shape,  at  a   =  10 deg.
This leading-edge profile  is a combination of 25-deg beveling
on the windward surface  and 25-deg beveling on the  leeward
surface.  The  flow  visualization photographs shown in this fig-
ure  suggest  no  formation  of  the  leading-edge  vortex,  which
falls into the same situation as the delta wing with the leading-
edge beveling 25 deg  on  the  leeward  surface.
Based on the flow  visualization results presented, it can be
said  that  the  configuration   of  the  leading-edge  beveling  on
the windward surface  can ensure the condition of sharp lead-
ing-edge separation, the case most favorable to the formation
of  the  organized vortex structures in this study.
Study  of  Velocity  Field
Laser-Doppler velocity measurements for the selected delta
wings at a  =  10 deg are presented in this section to describe
the quantitative aspects of the differences  associated with the
variations in  the  leading-edge profiles.

Figures  11 and  12 present  the  streamwise velocity  contour

tively,  in  the  Y-Z   cross-sectional  planes  at  x/C   =   0.3,  0.4,
and 0.5.  It  should  be  mentioned that for the  sake of conven-
ience the  measuring volume of the  laser velocimeter was tra-
versing  with  respect  to  the  laboratory  coordinates.  The  ve-
locity measurements were performed  over 250-300 grid points
for  each  Y-Z  cross-sectional  plane intercepting the  half-span
of  the delta wing.  In the plots of Figs.  11 and  12, the velocity
values  shown  are  normalized  by  the  freestream  velocity  UQ,
and  the  spatial  coordinates  are  normalized  by  the  length  of

Fig.     11    Streamwise  velocity contour plots of  the 50-deg sweep delta
wing with the leading-edge 25-deg beveling on the windward surface,

ture.  In   Fig.     12  the  streamwise  velocity  measured  near  the
wing surface  being higher is explained due to the attachment
of  flow  on  the  leeward  surface  of the  delta wing, rather than
the  formation  of  vortex  structure.  The  velocity  distributions
shown  in   Fig.      12  are  supplement  to  the   flow  visualization
findings  seen  in   Fig.     7.
In  addition to  the  survey over the velocity  fields  above the
delta wings, velocity measurements were performed  along the
leading edges  of  the  delta  wings  to  acquire  the  distributions
of flow angle associated with the leading-edge separated shear
layer.  The   measuring  volume  of  the  laser  velocimeter  was
positioned  1 mm above the leeward surface  of the delta wing
at  the  leading edge. The  flow  angle mentioned  is referred  to
the  angle  of  a  two-dimensional  velocity  vector  measured  in
the  X-Y   plane,  denoted  as  0  =  tan~lV/U.   At  each  of  the
points  measured,  the  flow  angle  is reduced  from  five  sets  of
consecutive measurements. Each set of the measurements was
performed  over  a time period  of  10 s.
Figure  13 presents the  distributions of the  flow  angle along
the  leading  edges  of  the  delta  wings  studied.  There  are  two
noticeable  features  in  this  figure.  First,  the  flow  angles  as-
sociated  with  the  cases  of  the  leading-edges 25-deg  beveling
on  the  windward  side  and  on  the  leeward  side  appear  to  be
the largest and the smallest, respectively, which can be further
correlated with the  previous flow  visualization results, that in
the  former  case the  leading-edge vortex  structure appears to
be the most well-organized and in the latter case no formation
of  vortex  structure  is  discerned.  Second,  for  all  the  cases
shown in  Fig.     13,  the flow-angle  distributions are not uniform
along  the  leading  edge.  Generally  speaking,  the  flow  angle

Discussion
To  understand  the  flow  structures  above  the  delta  wings
with different  leading-edge profiles calls for the need of three-
dimensional velocity distributions above the delta wings. Un-
fortunately,  the  laser  velocimeter  employed  is  limited  by  its
function    for   two-components   velocity   measurement   only,
therefore,  the  information  of  the  velocity  in  the  third  com-
ponent, i.e., the velocity Win the Z direction, is lacking from
direct  measurement.  Nevertheless,  this  drawback  was  over-
come by a numerical integration procedure to find  W,27  which
is based  on  the  continuity equation for three-dimensional in-
compressible  flow  and the  U and  V velocity data obtained in
two  neighboring  Y-Z  cross-sectional planes.
Figure  14 presents the  cross-sectional velocity vector  plots
obtained  at  x/C   =  0.4  for  two  delta  wings  with  the  leading-
edges  25-deg  beveling  on  the  windward  surface  and  on  the
leeward  surface.  These  velocity vectors  are  constructed  with
the mean  velocity data  of  V  and  W, where the  data of  W,  as
mentioned, are  deduced  from  the  U and  V velocity measure-
ments  obtained  in  the  two  Y-Z  cross-sectional  planes  at x/C
=  0.39  and  0.40.  In  Fig.  14a,  the  case  of  the  leading-edge
beveling  on  the  windward  side,  the  leading-edge  vortex  is
clearly  identified  in Fig.  14a.  The  vortex  core  appears to  be
at  Z/S   =  0.30 and  Y/S  =  0.45 roughly,  which coincides with
the  location  of  the  maximum  streamwise velocity seen in the
contour plot of x/C  -   0.4 in Fig. lib. Also noted in Fig. 14a
is that a region near the wall, at  Y/S  = 0.50-0.15, where the
flow  convecting  strongly  along  the  wing  surface  toward  the
leading  edge.  This  is  the  region  of  low  streamwise  velocity
measured,  shown  in  Fig.  lib.  For  the  case  of  the  leading-
edge  beveling  on  the  leeward  surface,  Fig.  14b  shows no  in-
dication concerning the formation  of the leading-edge vortex.
A  weak  cross-streamwise  motion  in the  region  about  Z/S   =
0.25  and  Y/S   =  0.30-0.75  indicates  that  the  flow  convects
from  the  leading  edge  to  the  root  chord,  which  is  seen  to
promote a weak formation  of streamwise vortex in the region
of  Z/S  <  0.25. Farther away from  the wing surface,  the cross-

streamwise motion appears in the opposite direction, namely
from  the root  chord  to  the  leading edge.
Based  on   the   flow   visualization  results  and  the   velocity
measurements  presented  in  the  previous  figures,  two  sche-
matic drawings depicting the cross-sectional views of the  sep-
arated  shear  layers developed  from  the  leading-edges 25-deg
beveling on the windward surface  and on the leeward surface
are  suggested  in Figs.  15a  and  15b,  respectively.  The  sketch
shown  in  Fig.  15a  describes  the  trajectory  of  the  separated
shear  layer  that  reaches  farthest   away  from   the  delta  wing
and  leads to  the formation  of organized vortex structure.  On
the  other  hand,  the  sketch  shown  in  Fig.  15b  describes  the
trajectory  of the separated  shear  layer that  stays close to  the
wing  surface  at  the  leading  edge,  and  results  in  a  weak  for-
mation  of  vortex  structure  being  developed  inboard  of  the
interception  of the  leeward  surface  and the  beveling surface.
Concluding Remarks
Flow visualizations and velocity measurements obtained for
50-deg sweep  delta  wings,  at  a  =  10 deg  mainly,  and  at  the
Reynolds number 7  x   103, illustrate that varying the leading-
edge  profile  of  the  delta wing  affects  the  development  of  the
three-dimensional  vortex  on  the  leeward  side.  The  configu-
ration  of the  leading-edge beveling on  the  windward  surface,
which  is the  most popular  in the  previous references  seen, is
found   to   ensure  the   formation   of  the   leading-edge  vortex
structure at a  =  10 deg. On the other hand, the configuration
of  the  leading-edge  beveling  on  the  leeward  surface  risks  to
lose the  leading-edge vortex  above the  delta  wing  at a  =  10
deg.  These  notable  differences  are  resorted  to  that  modifi-
cation  in  the  leading-edge  profile  affects  the  initial  state  of
the  separated  shear  layer,  as  realized  from   the   flow-angle
measurements in the X-Y   plane along the leading edge, con-
sequently,  the  trajectory  of  the  separated  shear  layer  above
the  delta  wing.  The  present  results  call  for  the  attention  to
the  geometrical  shape  of  the  leading-edge  profile  if  a  delta
wing model  is under  preparation  for  experiment.
