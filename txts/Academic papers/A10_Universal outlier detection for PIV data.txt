Abstract  An adaptation of the original median test for
the  detection  of  spurious  PIV  data  is  proposed  that
normalizes the median residual with respect to a robust
estimate of the local variation of the velocity. It is dem-
onstrated that the normalized median test yields a more
or  less  ‘universal’  probability  density  function  for  the
residual and that a single threshold value can be applied
to effectively detect spurious vectors. The generality of
the proposed method is verified by the application to a
large variety of documented flow cases with values of the
Reynolds number ranging from 101 to 107.
The  so-called  ‘median  test’  is  the  most  widely  used
method for outlier detection in post-interrogation vali-
dation of PIV data (Westerweel 1994). The principle and
effectiveness of the original method was demonstrated for
homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, for which a single
outlier detection threshold can be applied to the entire
data set on the basis of the velocity fluctuation intensity.
The original paper contains an appendix that describes
the application of the method for general (turbulent) flow
fields,  but  this  recipe  is  quite  elaborate  and  requires  a
priori  information  of  the  flow  field;  this  procedure
has?to the best of the authors knowledge?never been
actually applied in practice. Instead, it is quite common to
apply  a  single  detection  threshold  in  the  evaluation  of
(strongly) inhomogeneous flow data. For example, in a
PIV  measurement  of  a  submerged  turbulent  jet  (see
Fig. 1)  the  observed  flow  region  contains  both  high-
velocity turbulent data (inside the jet) and low-velocity
laminar data (outside the jet); the average value of the
median vector residual correlates with the mean velocity
(Fig. 1).  This  means  that  a  single  detection  threshold
applied to the entire flow domain will generally tend to
reject part of the valid measurement data in the turbulent
flow region and to accept part of the spurious measure-
ment data in the laminar flow region. This problem even
occurs  in  experiments  where  the  assumption  of  (near)
homogeneous  and  (near)  isotropic  turbulence  appears
applicable,   i.e.,   grid-generated   turbulence.   Figure 2
shows  histograms  of  the  median  vector  residuals  from
PIV measurements in grid turbulence at three distances
from the grid (Poelma 2004); the mean residual clearly
decays in correspondence to the decay of the turbulent
kinetic energy. Again, a single detection threshold would
tend to accept an increasing fraction of spurious data as
the measurement location moves away from the grid.
This effect, illustrated in the two examples above, can
be  avoided  when  the  residual  is  normalized  with  an
estimate  of  the  local  instantaneous  flow  fluctuations
physically expected. The most straightforward choice is
to  adopt  the  root-mean-square  velocity  fluctuation  u￠
evaluated  within  a  close  neighborhood  of  the  vector
under consideration. However in general two problems
occur: (1) for the estimation of u￠ only a small number of
data  is  available  (i.e.,  typically  only  8  to  24?strongly
correlated?data points in a 3・3 or 5・5 neighborhood),
and  (2)  the  local  neighborhood  can  contain  spurious
measurement  data  which  makes  the  estimation  of  u￠
unreliable. Effectively, the presence of a spurious mea-
surement  will  result  in  an  over-estimated  value  for  u￠
which will reduce the value of the ‘normalized residual’
and possibly will make the estimated residual drop be-
low the chosen threshold value; hence, this will make it
more difficult to detect spurious data in the presence of
other spurious data.

determine  a  local  threshold  value  that  should  account

for the local variation of u￠ and for local gradients. Al-
though this method enhances the detection efficiency, it
still relies on a (stringent) initial outlier detection and an
appropriate choice of a filter length; both will depend on
the  interrogation  resolution  and  experimental  condi-
tions.
The authors therefore propose an adaptation of the
original  median  test  that  uses  a  median  estimate  of  u￠
that  is  robust  with  respect  to  the  presence  of  spurious
measurement  data  in  the  neighborhood.  Consider  a
displacement  vector  denoted  by  U0,  its  3・3-neighbor-
hood  data,  denoted  by  {U1,U2,...,U8},  and  Um  as  the
median  of  {U1,U2,...,U8}  (following  the  procedure  for
vector data (Westerweel 1994); note that U0 is excluded).
A residual ri, defined as: ri=|UiUm| (Westerweel 1994),
is  determined  for  each  vector  {Ui  |  i=1,...,8},  and  the
median  rm   of  {r1,r2,...,r8}  is  used  to  normalize  the
residual of U0:
r00  ? jU0  Umj
rm       :                                                            d1T
The algorithm is represented in pseudo code and as a
Matlab  macro  in  the  Appendix.  This  method  is  quite
general  in  outlier  detection  (Barnett  and  Lewis  1978)
and can be used to process a large variety of inhomo-
geneous data, including e.g. traffic data (Shekhar et al.
2001; Wouters et al. 2005, in press).
When the residual defined in Eq. 1 is applied to the
grid turbulence data, it is found that the histograms of
the residuals approximately  collapse on a single  curve,
i.e., the residuals for the normalized median test become
independent of the turbulence level, as shown in Fig. 2b.
When  the  normalized  median  test  is  applied  to  the  jet
data of Fig. 1, the correlation between the mean residual
and   the   mean   displacement   has   been   substantially
attenuated,  as  is  evident  by  comparing  Fig. 1c  with
Fig. 3a.  However,   a  weak   correlation  of   the  mean
residual and the turbulence level remains visible, and it
was found that r0￠ shows elevated values for regions with
very  low  turbulence  intensities  (e.g.,  the  laminar  outer
flow  regions  of  jets  and  boundary  layers).  In  fact,  for
purely uniform flow, the normalization factor rm￠ tends
to zero. This can be compensated by assuming a mini-
mum normalization level e, i.e.:
r0  ? jU0  Umj
rm t e   ;                                                            d2T
where  e may  represent  the  acceptable  fluctuation  level
due  to  cross-correlation.  Evidently,  Eq. 2  with  e ” 0
yields Eq. 1. It was found that a suitable value for e is
about 0.1 px, which would correspond to the typical rms
noise level of the PIV data (Westerweel 2000).
In Fig. 3b is also shown the mean residual as defined
in Eq. 2 with e = 0.1 px; this has further attenuated the
correlation  between  the  mean  residual  and  turbulence
level.
We  now  demonstrate  that  the  normalized  median
test  yields  residuals  with  a  more  or  less  ‘universal’

Reynolds numbers from 0.1 (for micro-channel flow) to
107  (for the supersonic wake). Histograms of the resid-
uals for the conventional median test and the normalized
median test are shown in Fig. 4. The histograms of the
residuals for the conventional median test strongly de-
pend  on  the  experimental  conditions,  whereas  the  his-
tograms for the residuals of the normalized median test
appear to more or less collapse on a single curve. This
graph also shows how the residuals for the conventional
median test depend on the interrogation resolution (e.g.,
compare  the  32・32-px  and  16・16-px  jet  data),  which
implies that each pass in a multi-grid or multi-scale PIV
interrogation would require its own (optimal) detection
level  for  the  identification  of  spurious  data;  the  same
data for the normalized median test practically coincide,
so  that  for  each  pass  the  same  detection  level  can  be
used.
When  the  histograms  of  the  residual  for  the  nor-
malized median test in Fig. 4 would be integrated, it is
found  that  the  90-percentile  occurs  for  r￠    2.  This
means that in all cases a single detection threshold can
be used that labels the largest 10% of residuals. A value
larger  than  2  would  yield  a  less  stringent  detection,
whereas  a  value  smaller  than  2  would  yield  a  more
stringent  detection.  Hence,  we  now  have  a  detection
threshold that is more or less independent of the (local)
level of the velocity fluctuations, and that even appears
valid for different experimental conditions.
In Fig. 5 are shown the vector plots from four arbi-
trary  examples  of  the  data  listed  in  Table 1.  Each  of
these examples clearly shows a small fraction of spurious
vectors,  and  in  each  example  vectors  with  a  residual
r*>2 have been indicated by a red color, which essen-
tially  captures  all  the  spurious  vector  data  in  each  of
these four examples.
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that a small
adaptation of the original algorithm for the median test
of PIV data yields a ‘universal’ distribution of the nor-
malized  residual.  Instead  of  a  detection  threshold  for
spurious vector data that is specific to each experiment,
or  different  flow  regions  within  a  PIV  measurement
domain,  it  is  now  possible  to  use  a  single  detection
threshold that would be applicable to a variety of flow
conditions without any a priori knowledge of the flow
characteristics   (e.g.,   turbulence  level).  The  universal
character makes it also possible to use a single detection
threshold  in  transient  flows  (e.g.,  in  laminar-turbulent
transition).
A threshold value of about 2 seems to be an appro-
priate choice, with smaller and larger values leading to a
more   stringent   and   less   stringent   outlier   detection
respectively. The use of a normalized median test makes
the  implementation  of  multi-pass  or  multi-grid  PIV

median  test  eliminates  a  dependence  of  the  detection
criterion  on  the  interrogation  domain  size.  It  is  also  a
great help to inexperienced users who can use a thresh-
old value of 2 as a convenient starting point for outlier
detection.
