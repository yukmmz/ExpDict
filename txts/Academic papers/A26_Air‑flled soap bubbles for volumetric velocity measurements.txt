Abstract
The use of air-filled soap bubbles for volumetric velocimetry in air flows is demonstrated experimentally. The tracers are 
produced by a novel system that seeds high number density soap bubble streams for particle image velocimetry applica-
tions. Particle number density considerations, spatial resolution and response time scales are discussed in light of current 
seeding techniques for volumetric measurements. The micro-soap bubbles are employed to measure the 3D velocity field in 
intermediate-sized flow volumes of 75?500?cm3 , which are difficult to measure with existing tracers such as liquid droplets 
or relatively large helium-filled soap bubbles, while resolving small-scale flow variations. The mean volumetric concentra-
tion of approximately 50 tracers per cm3 provides a potential for high-resolution measurements. Finally, the methodology 
is demonstrated for velocity measurements in the wake of a sphere immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. Both the wake 
structures and the boundary layer statistics are characterized successfully with a reasonable spatial resolution.

1  Introduction
Volumetric velocimetry is a key enabler for understanding 
turbulent flows, which are inherently unsteady and three-
dimensional.  Multiple  methods  have  been  designed  to 
measure 3D velocity fields accurately. In particular, particle 
image velocimetry (PIV) and particle tracking velocimetry 
(PTV) are now widely employed in various flow configura-
tions (Discetti and Coletti 2018). All of these techniques rely 
on imaging of discrete seeding tracers suspended in the flow. 
While larger seeding particles scatter more light from the 
illuminating source, smaller ones follow the flow more accu-
rately and can resolve smaller scale variations. This trade-off 
is inherent to particle-based velocimetry (Melling 1997).
Adrian and Westerweel give a detailed discussion of pos-
sible tracer particles for gases and their performance (Adrian 
and Westerweel 2001). Current seeding tracers for air flows 
include micron-sized oil and di-ethyl-hexyl-sebacic acid 
ester (DEHS) droplets (Kahler et?al. 2002) as well as soap

bubbles filled with a low-density gas such as helium. While 
droplets of size 1 μ m typically can follow fluid elements 
faithfully and remain suspended in the flow, the maximum 
size of the volumetric domain considered is usually limited 
to smaller than 50cm3 (Scarano 2013). On the other hand, 
large helium-filled soap bubbles (HFSB) ranging from 1 to 
5mm allow only qualitative investigation of larger domains, 
as they do not faithfully follow the flow like neutrally buoy-
ant bubbles (Kerho and Bragg 1994). By contrast, submil-
limeter (300 μ m) helium-filled soap bubbles have been 
utilized successfully in both low and high-speed tomo-PIV 
configurations for large-scale aerodynamic applications 
(Scarano et?al. 2015) in domains larger than 4500cm3.
A compilation of volumetric measurements in air flows 
using these seeding strategies is shown in Fig.?1. There is 
a noticeable gap between volumetric domains in the range 
between nearly 50cm3 and 5000cm3 . This is an effect of 
the large difference between the mean seeding diameters 
of DEHS droplets and HFSB bubbles. The purpose of the 
current work is to demonstrate the viability of smaller size 
air-filled soap bubbles as seeding tracers in gas volumes of 
intermediate size. The bubbles are generated by the rapid 
depressurization of a pressurized mixture of liquid and sur-
factant. The depressurization causes the gas to leave the liq-
uid media. This controlled degasification inside a reservoir 
produces a large number of soap bubbles with mean diam-
eter of 15μm . The bubbles can be imaged easily either by 
low or high-speed light sources, yet they are small enough 
to resolve turbulent flow structures in intermediate-size 
domains.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sect.?2, we discuss 
spatial and image considerations for volumetric velocimetry 
in air flows, focusing on the seeding size. The methodology 
to generate the soap bubbles and their characteristics are out-
lined in Sect.?3, where a full description of the response time 
of the tracers is demonstrated theoretically and experimen-
tally. A demonstration of the use of micro-soap bubbles in 
volumetric wind-tunnel measurements is provided in Sect.?4. 
Finally, our concluding remarks and perspectives on these 
new seeding tracers are discussed.
2  Considerations of?seeding size
Consider a volume V =L×H×W imaged by a camera with 
a pixel resolution l? , pixel pitch pix equipped with an optical 
system with numerical aperture f# by the use of an illuminat-
ing source with wavelength  . In the volume V, W represents 
the depth of the domain.
The depth of focus reads
Here, M is the optical magnification M = l?pix?L.
Let dp be the diameter of the seeding particle. The particle 
image diameter can be calculated from

where ddiff.  = 2.44f#(1 + M) is the diffraction limited mini-
mum image diameter and dB is the blur circle diameter (Raf-
fel et?al. 2018; Scarano 2013).
Let us take the example of the experiments performed 
in Scarano et?al. (2015) with HFSB bubbles. The illumi-
nated volume was such that L =H =200mm , W=120mm , 
l? = 1024px , pix  = 20 μm and f# =32 to ensure focus along 
all the depth W ( Z ?300mm ). Assuming dp = 400μm 
and neglecting dB , the resulting particle image diameter is 
d? = 3px , a consistent value found by the authors in their 
experiments of helium bubbles. Now, decreasing the domain 
size to L =H =50mm while keeping all other parameters 
the same, d? = 9px due to the change of optical magnifica-
tion resulting in Z ?30mm , i.e., an equivalent volume of 
approximately V =75cm3 when compared to V =4800cm3 
from Scarano et?al. (2015). To obtain nearly optimal parti-
cle image diameters of d? = 3px , the tracer size should be 
reduced to about dp = 30μm or less considering the diffrac-
tion limit. Here, the value of three pixels is near optimal for 
minimizing both bias and random error in calculating PIV 
particle displacement (Adrian and Westerweel 2001).
These examples clearly demonstrate that seeding tracers 
with diameter an order of magnitude smaller than HFSB are 
preferable for intermediate volume domains. At the same 
time, the tracers must be larger than DEHS droplets to scat-
ter more light. Additionally, one should note that d? = 9px 
for a helium-filled soap bubble image would introduce a dou-
blet pattern resulting from the presence of two glare spots 
(Scarano et?al. 2015). This aspect makes the helium-filled 
soap bubbles less suitable for such a field-of-view. Specifi-
cally, pairs of glare points add complexity and uncertainty 
to identification of particle centers in tracking methods and 
ambiguity in determination of the correct displacement peak 
in PIV correlation methods.
Another point of interest is the final resolution of the 
velocity measurements. Consider now the same domain 
V =L×H×W divided in voxels. We define lIB as the length 
of the interrogation box (IB), i.e., the spatial resolution of 
the particle-based velocimetry. The number of seeding par-
ticles within the interrogation box is given by:
Here, nvIB is the number of voxels per interrogation box, 
and C= Np?V is the volumetric particle concentration. 
The tracer concentration C can be written as a function of 
the source density Ns and the particle image diameter d? 
(Scarano 2013):
d? = √(Mdp)2  + ddiff.                                                                            (2)

.
Then, the number of particles per interrogation box reads
Assuming nvIB  = (lIB?lv)3 , where lv is the voxel length, and 
noting that lvM =pix , we obtain lIB ∝d 23 for a desired 
number of particles per IB (usually between 5 and 10 par-
ticles) and optimal source density (Scarano 2013). Thus, 
for intermediate sized volumes, a substantial gain in spatial 
resolution is expected by decreasing dp from 400 to 30μm , 
for example. The size of these tracers allows for a higher 
number density per unit volume which enables them to fol-
low the turbulent structures of the flow and achieve higher 
spatial resolution measurements.
3  Description of?the?micro?soap bubbles
3.1   Bubble generator
Common methods to generate soap bubbles include pushing 
or blowing a gas stream through a liquid film. The support 
of the liquid film determines the dimension of the produced 
bubble. The method described here overcomes this limita-
tion by using the process of cavitation in liquid media (Payri 
et?al. 2009; Gharib and Kim 2019). The mechanism govern-
ing the bubble generation is the rapid depressurization of a 
pressurized solution of liquid containing a certain amount 
of surfactant.
A schematic of the current device is seen in Fig.?2. It 
consists of a 57 liter reservoir filled approximately one-third 
full with a 5% surfactant-water solution. The surfactant used 
was a commonly available dish-washing detergent (Palmo-
live Pure+Clear) without any added dyes or fragrance and 
density of approximately 1.06 g?cm3 . The product ingredi-
ents were ammonium lauryl sulfate, lauramidopropylamine 
oxide, and isodeceth-6.
A tube at the bottom of the reservoir feeds the solution 
through a set of particulate filters followed by a reciprocat-
ing piston pump that pressurizes the fluid to approximately 
70 bars. The pressurized liquid then travels through high-
pressure tubing to a set of 10 nozzles, each with outlet diam-
eter of 0.2 mm . Within each nozzle, the liquid is accelerated 
through an area ratio of 156:1 to decrease the local pressure. 
Gas volumes formed by cavitation then collapse and implode 
fragmenting into many small bubbles.
The bubble streams exiting the nozzles are directed down-
ward toward the free surface of the reservoir bath. Pressur-
ized air is introduced into the reservoir to generate a mild

cyclonic flow that causes larger bubbles and droplets to 
impact the sidewalls and be reintroduced into the solution, 
while the remaining bubbles and the air stream exit through 
an opening at the top of the reservoir. Most of the bubbles 
created in this way remain suspended for long periods of 
time.
3.2   Bubble size characterization
In order to characterize the bubble size, a phase Doppler 
particle analysis (PDPA) system was used (Bachalo 1980). 
PDPA uses a set of crossed laser beams to create an inter-
ference fringe pattern at the point where the beams cross. 
Spherical particles passing through the beam crossing scatter 
light collected by a receiver with an array of three detectors. 
The phase lag of the scattered light between detectors is 
proportional to the particle diameter.
A flexible tube 10 cm in diameter and 3 meters long 
was attached to the exit on top of the bubble generator. 
The PDPA system was positioned to measure the bubbles 
as they exited the tube. The generator produced a flux on 
the order of 107 particles per second, resulting in a con-
centration of 105 tracers?cm3 at the outlet of the flexible 
tube. Figure?3 shows the measured diameter distribution 
of the bubbles generated by the device. The mean diam-
eter was 14.7?μ m with a standard deviation of 7.3?μ m. The 
inset shows a high-magnification shadowgraph image of a 
microbubble obtained using a PowerView CCD 8MP cam-
era ( pix  = 5.5 μm ) equipped with a long-distance micro-
scope Model K2 DistaMax yielding a digital resolution of 
1.5 μm?px.
3.3   Theoretical estimation of?the?bubble response 
time
A primary factor that affects the ability of the tracer to faith-
fully follow the flow is the sum of forces acting on the parti-
cle. A complete account for the motion of small particles in 
a given flow field can be found in Maxey and Riley (1983). 
Following Maxey and Riley (1983) and Mei (1996), Adrian 
and Westerweel (2001) proposed the following expression 
for the particle response time p:
where p is the particle density, f the fluid density and μ the 
dynamic viscosity of the ambient fluid. The factor  corrects 
for the particle Reynolds number Rep (see Clift et?al. (1978) 
for a detailed account). To estimate the response time of 
seeding tracers commonly used in airflow experiments, we 
compute p using Eq. ?6 and present the values in Table?1 
for various particles considering the Stokes regime ( =1 ). 
We consider here air at 20?C and 1 atm . It is important to 
note that =1 provides a conservative estimation of p since 
the slip flow and resulting finite particle Reynolds number 
increases the value of .
Micron-sized DEHS droplets are recognized to faithfully 
follow the flow due to their reduced size and can be con-
sidered as a reference particle. The characteristics of the 
DEHS particles used for the calculation of p were the same 
as presented in Kahler et?al. (2002). The response time of 
DEHS particles obtained is about 3 μ s, in very good agree-
ment when compared to the experimental results of Ragni 
et?al. (2011), where p =2 μ s for shock accelerated tracers.
The same estimation was performed for helium- and 
air-filled soap bubbles (HFSB and AFSB) with properties 
p  = dp2                                                                                                               (6)

matching those listed in Faleiros et?al. (2018). Our calcula-
tion of p using Eq. ?6 for HFSB bubbles slightly lighter than 
air results in p =90 μ s. This lag is at least fifteen times 
smaller than the estimated response time of the AFSB bub-
bles, which have a much larger particle-fluid density differ-
ence. Measurements of HFSB response time performed by 
Faleiros et?al. (2018, 2019) in the flow upstream of a circular 
cylinder yielded experimental magnitudes of p of 10?50 μ s 
with a dispersion of approximately 40 μ s. They also reported 
a response time for AFSB of approximately p =400 μ s. 
In both cases, these experimental values of p are smaller 
than our theoretical estimates. This can be explained by the 
significant slip velocity yielding a correction factor  larger 
than unity. Meanwhile, in the absence of direct slip velocity 
measurements, Eq.?6 appears to be a good estimator of the 
considered response time. According to Kerho and Bragg 
(1994) and Afanasyev et?al. (2011), the wall thickness of 
soap bubbles lies in the range 0.1?0.3 μ m. Indeed, from the 
characteristics of HFSB and AFSB tracers described above, 
a wall-thickness in the range 0.1?0.2 μ m was calculated to 
match the value of p indicated by Faleiros et?al. (2018). 
Considering the bubble wall thickness in the range 0.1?0.3 
μ m and the particle diameter 10?30 μ m , a response time 
range 20?160μs was estimated for the micro-soap bubbles 
of the current work, suggesting tracing fidelity capabilities 
comparable to the HFSB tracers.
3.4   Measurement of?the?bubble response time
The response time of the micro-soap bubbles was obtained 
experimentally following the protocol described in previ-
ous investigations on HFSB bubbles (Scarano et?al. 2015; 
Faleiros et?al. 2018, 2019; Gibeau and Ghaemi 2018; Gibeau 
et?al. 2020). In steady flows, the particle response time can 
be computed as the ratio between the slip velocity and local 
fluid acceleration:
Here, u is the fluid velocity, up is the particle velocity and 
the local particle acceleration is kept the same as the fluid 
acceleration.
We consider the decelerating flow upstream of a circular 
cylinder. The experiments were performed in a closed-cir-
cuit wind tunnel with test section dimension 1.3 ×0.96 m2 
and free-stream velocity U∞ =15ms?1 . The turbulence 
intensity at this free-stream condition is of order 1%. A 
circular cylinder with diameter  D=70mm and length 
10D is mounted mid height, yielding a nominally two-
dimensional flow at the cylinder midspan with a Reynolds

number Re = fU∞D?μ = 6.8 ×104 . This geometry gives 
a blockage ratio of 4% with negligible blockage effects 
(West and Apelt 1982).
PIV  measurements  were  performed  to  compute  the 
fluid  and particle (bubble)  velocities u and up respec-
tively. The local fluid velocity u is approximated by the 
velocity field obtained from PIV measurements using oil 
droplets of diameter ?1 μ m generated by a Laskin nozzle 
generator. This is justified by their very small response 
time and high tracing fidelity. An Evergreen 200 mJ laser 
was used to illuminate a planar field of view limited by 
x ∈ [?80, 0] mm and y ∈ [?30, 30] mm , where (x, y) = (0, 0) 
is the stagnation point of the cylinder. A TSI Powerview 
8MP camera ( 3320×2496 pixels, pix  = 5.5 μm ) equipped 
with a 135-mm objective at numerical aperture  f#  =5.6 
was used to acquire 3000 double-frame images with time 
separation  of t =20 μ s  and  sampling  rate  3  Hz.  The 
resulting image magnification is M=0.165 . The images 
were processed using TSI INSIGHT4G, with a recursive, 
cross-correlation, ensemble PIV scheme with interrogation 
window of 64 pixels and 50% overlap yielding the final 
vector spacing of 1.06mm. These parameters were used 
for both u and up measurements. Oil droplet and bubble 
measurements were performed on separate days to avoid 
any cross-contamination of tracers.
The mean streamwise velocity and acceleration decay 
for bubbles ( up ) along the stagnation streamline is depicted 
in Fig.?4. The reference fluid velocity u obtained from 
the oil droplets measurements is also displayed for com-
parison. The entire flow field (see inset) represents with 
fidelity the nominal potential flow upstream of the circular 
cylinder, and a similar flow topology was obtained using 
the reference oil droplets as seeding tracers. Along the 
streamline, the mean slip velocity |u?up| is 0.12 ms?1 , 
which corresponds to 0.8% of the freestream speed and 
1.4% mean local velocity deviation.
To compute the bubble response time p , we first per-
formed a local regression filter (loess in MATLAB) on 
both u and up to remove residual waviness of the data and 
to obtain a smooth velocity acceleration decay. Then, p 
was calculated using Eq. ?7. The mean response time com-
puted  along  the  stagnation  streamline  in  the  region 
0.5D <x <0 within a strip of 4 mm is p =40 μ s with 
standard deviation p  =30 μ s. This selected region of 
large deceleration close to the stagnation point was also 
considered  in  Scarano  et? al.  (2015)  and  Gibeau  and 
Ghaemi (2018) to obtain p for HFSB bubbles. The meas-
ured p =40 μ s lies within the theoretical range 20?160 μ s 
estimated using Eq. ?6, where both bubble film thickness 
and diameter ranges were considered. A response time of 
40 μ s would correspond to bubbles with diameter 15 (25) 
μ m and film thickness of 0.15 (0.1) μ m, respectively. 
These values correspond well to the measured particle 
diameter distribution presented in Sect.?3.2.
It is important to consider that our calculation of p and 
p considered velocity values obtained from a cross correla-
tion algorithm within the PIV interrogation window, in 
which tracers with multiple properties exist. These effective 
time scales allows one to compute ideally minimum flow 
time scales to be measured by the current tracers. As dis-
cussed by Gibeau et?al. (2020), the resulting minimum meas-
urable flow time scale reads f = 10 × (p + 2p ) = 1000 μ s 
with  95%  confidence,  accounting  for  a  Stokes  number 
Sk = ??p???f  < 0.1 for tracer reliability (Tropea and Yarin 
2007).
4  Volumetric measurements
Experiments were conducted in two wind tunnels of the 
Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics of 
the University of Minnesota to characterize the performance 
of the micro-soap bubbles at two volumetric scales.
4.1   Bubble number density and?robustness
Experiments were performed in a large recirculating wind 
tunnel  driven  by  a  frequency-controlled  P-38  propeller 
(same as that used for the experiments in Section?3.4) in 
order to assess bubble quality in images and bubble robust-
ness over different recirculation times. The flow conditioning 
upstream of the closed test section includes a honeycomb 
flow straightener with cell size of 8mm followed by a set 
of four screens with openings of 700μm . The contraction 
is three-dimensional with a 6.5:1 area ratio. The test sec-
tion measures 1.37 m wide, 0.96 m high, and 2.9 m in length. 
A volumetric imaging system consisting of four Phantom 
VEO340 4MP cameras (2560 x 1600 pixels, pix  = 10 μm ) 
fitted with 135mm lenses and  f# =22 operating at 800Hz 
were aligned on the measuring volume illuminated by a 30 
mJ/pulse dual-head Nd:YLF laser positioned on top of the 
wind tunnel, with a mirror directing the illumination down 
into the test section through a window on the top of the tun-
nel. Light volume optics were used to illuminate a volume 
of 490cm3 with dimensions 130×75×50mm3 . This vol-
ume lies between the traditional volumetric domains inves-
tigated using either DEHS droplets or HSFB bubbles (see 
Fig.?1). A synchronizer timing device with timing resolution 
of 0.2 ns coordinated the laser pulses and camera image 
capture, and the images of the bubbles were processed with 
INSIGHTV3V-4G software. Details of the processing rou-
tines used can be found in Boomsma and Troolin (2018).
The tests demonstrated the capability of performing 
large-scale measurements with a free-stream flow velocity

of 2.3 ms?1 . The distribution of the tracers in the volume 
of interest is shown in Fig.?5. Here, 14000 bubbles were 
tracked, and the bubble digital image diameters were dis-
tributed across 3-4 pixels on average. After filling the 
tunnel with bubbles, the bubble generator was turned off, 
allowing the bubbles to recirculate for 5 minutes. During 
this period, there was a reduction of 32% in the number 
of tracers imaged. After an additional 5, 10, and 20 min-
utes, 64%, 47%, and 33% of the initial number of bubbles 
remained, respectively. The measurements used to com-
pute the response time in section?3.4 were performed 10 
minutes after the generator was turned off.
The initial relatively rapid decrease in concentration can 
be attributed to two potential factors. First, one may assume 
the existence of some droplets emanating from the bubble 
generator. Any droplets with diameter within the range 
7-35 μm will tend to settle out in a period not exceeding 5 
minutes after the bubble generator is turned off. In addition, 
water droplets in the range 1-4 μm would tend to evaporate 
completely over the same period, while larger ones would 
decrease in diameter. Second, some fraction of micro-soap 
bubbles (possibly the largest ones) may disappear in the 
first minutes due to impacts with surfaces and screens in the 
recirculating wind tunnel. The bubbles were also tested for 
larger free-stream speeds up to 25ms?1 . The bubbles were 
still robust, recirculating for long periods, although the con-
centration in the images was lower after a comparable time 
delay.
4.2   Measurements in?turbulent flow
Another set of experiments was performed in an open-circuit 
wind tunnel to assess the capability of bubbles to track rela-
tively small-scale motions in turbulence. Two flows were 
considered: a canonical turbulent boundary layer and the 
near wake downstream of a sphere embedded within the 
boundary layer.
4.2.1   Experimental setup
A  sketch  of  the  test  section  and  experimental  setup  is 
shown in Fig.?6a. The test section has a cross section of 
600×600mm2 and a maximum flow speed of 40ms?1 . A 
trip wire was placed at the entrance of the test section to 
generate a turbulent boundary layer. The wind tunnel was 
driven by a frequency controlled variable speed motor and 
operated here with a fixed free-stream velocity Uo of 3ms?1 . 
The estimated friction Reynolds number of the developing 
turbulent boundary layer at the measurement location was 
Re =500 with a viscous length scale 0.1 mm.
For  volumetric  velocity  measurements,  a  V3V-Flex 
traverse system from TSI Incorporated was employed and 
displaced according to the sketch of Fig.?6a, b. Four 4MP 
cameras (Cam1 to Cam4, 2560×1600 pixels, pix  = 10 μm ) 
equipped with Scheimpflug adapters were aligned in a planar 
configuration to image the illuminated volume. Each camera 
was equipped with a 135mm lens with numerical aperture 
f# =16 and f# =11 for forward and back-scattering cameras, 
respectively. The acquisition frequency was 400 Hz. The 
mean resulting optical magnification considering the four 
cameras was M=0.28 . The measuring volume was illumi-
nated by a 30mJ/pulse dual-head Nd:YLF laser positioned 
at the open outlet of the wind tunnel. The volume of interest 
of 75cm3 (VOI, dimensions 90×56×15mm3 ) was located 
1650mm downstream of the trip wire with its side plane at 
the center line of the wind tunnel. A timing box was used 
to synchronize the laser pulses and the cameras. A sample

raw image of the bubbles is depicted in Fig.?7. The bubbles 
display image diameters in the range d? = 1-4 pixels.
Hereafter, the streamwise, wall-normal, and spanwise 
directions are denoted by x, y, and z, respectively. The 
instantaneous velocity fluctuations in the corresponding 
directions are denoted by u, v and w, while the associated 
mean velocities are defined by U, V and W, respectively. 
All quantities normalized by the boundary layer friction 
velocity u and the kinematic viscosity  are denoted with 
a superscript (+) . The root mean square value of a quantity 
is denoted by a prime (?) , and its ensemble average is repre-
sented by an angle bracket (??).
Measurements were conducted for two flow configu-
rations: unperturbed and sphere-perturbed (SP) turbu-
lent boundary layer. For the SP case, a sphere (diameter 
D=25mm , D+ =240 ) held in place by a spanwise rod 
through its center was mounted inside the test section 
109mm upstream of the VOI center location (see red cross 
in Fig.?6a). Two SP cases were considered by changing the 
gap distance G between the bottom of the sphere and the 
wall, G=0 and R, where R is the sphere radius. These two 
configurations are denoted as SP-G0 and SP-GR, respec-
tively. In all cases, the time interval between successive 
frames was 150μs and two sampling frequencies 60Hz and 
400Hz were selected.
Both the calibration and image processing steps prior 
to volumetric velocity computation were performed in 
Insight V3V 4G. The 3D particle tracking and reconstruc-
tion method is fully described in Boomsma and Troolin 
(2018). For image processing, the raw images were pre-
processed using the following steps to reduce background 
and noise effects: 1) apply a 3×3 pixel Gaussian filter to 
remove the noise; 2) subtract a local median ( 9×9 pixels) 
to remove the background; 3) subtract a constant intensity 
of 10 and multiply by a constant value of 5 to increase the 
contrast; 4) apply a 7×7 pixel Gaussian filter to facilitate 
the particle identification process. For each snapshot, the 
number of identified bubbles within the VOI was in the 
range 5000?8000.

For  instantaneous  velocity  fields  presented  herein, 
the 3D velocity vectors associated with identified bub-
bles were binned into a uniform grid. Bad vectors (those 
exceeding the local mean value ± three times the standard 
deviation in a given bin) were removed to obtain fields 
with a uniform vector spacing of 2×2×2mm3 . In the 
binned flow fields, any local outliers (exceeding the local 
mean value ±  times the standard deviation, where  =3 
for u, v and w velocity components) were removed. Fig-
ure?8 shows a binned velocity vector field for one snapshot.
4.2.2   Results
The capability of the micro-soap bubbles was first inves-
tigated under the unperturbed condition by comparing the 
resulting statistical velocity profiles with results from a direct 
numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent boundary layer 
at a similar Reynolds number ( Re =580 ). The numerical 
data set is extracted from Jimenez et?al. (2010). The experi-
mental statistics were obtained based on ensemble aver-
ages of vectors present in 1500 snapshots. For the averaged 
statistics, all vectors were inserted into bins according to 
their location. Mean and rms values were computed at each 
location. Any outliers beyond three standard deviations in 
any component were removed, and the mean and rms values 
were recalculated. As presented in Fig.?9, the profiles of the

mean streamwise velocity U, in-plane velocity fluctuations 
(u′ , v′ ) and the related Reynolds shear stress ?uv? agree quite 
well with those from the DNS, thus demonstrating excel-
lent measurement quality. The values of spanwise velocity 
fluctuations ( w′ ), however, are higher than in the DNS ref-
erence data reflecting the larger uncertainty in the out-of-
plane component which is of order 0.5 pixels. Considering 
the inner length scale l = ?u = 0.1 mm obtained from the 
estimated friction velocity u =0.142 ms?1 , the associated 
flow time scale in the boundary layer is  = l?u ? 700 μ s. 
Although this time scale is smaller than the measurable time 
scale estimated in section?3.4 ( f =1000 μs), we note that the 
tracing fidelity of the employed bubbles is clearly sufficient 
to reproduce the Reynolds stresses as presented in Fig.?9.
Figure?10 depicts two flow snapshots each of the sphere-
perturbed configurations (SP-G0 and SP-GR). In the case 
where the sphere is close to the wall (SP-G0), the majority of 
vortical structures induced by the sphere are located within 
y <D . Also, these shed structures present mainly a negative 
vorticity sign (clockwise rotation), while alternating vortices 
are shed from the sphere for the SP-GR configuration shown 
in Fig.?10b, d. In this case, the vortical activity is spread 
across the region within 0.5D <y <2D . The complexity 
of the vorticity field can be explained by the combination 
of vortices convected within the turbulent boundary layer, 
the ejected fluid below the sphere and the vortex shedding 
downstream of the sphere.
5  Concluding remarks
The current experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using 
air-filled micro-soap bubbles to obtain high-quality planar 
and volumetric velocity measurements in air flows with 
intermediate-sized volumes in the range 75?500cm3 . This 
seeding methodology thus complements existing methods of 
1?μ m liquid droplets optimized for smaller volumes and 400 
μ m helium-filled soap bubbles appropriate for larger vol-
umes. The air-filled microbubble tracers, which have mean 
diameters of approximately 15 μ m, offer much stronger scat-
tering capability than 1 μ m droplets, yet also have relatively 
small response time. The measured mean response time was

40 μ s with a dispersion of 30 μ s. The bubbles can be gen-
erated at high rates to fill large facilities or with relatively 
large local concentration (50 tracers per cm3 ) that can be 
sustained over time. When introduced into a recirculating 
wind tunnel, the bubbles were robust and long lasting. When 
employed as tracers in an illuminated volume of a turbulent 
boundary layer, the bubbles yielded averaged mean and rms 
statistics of high quality. Also, instantaneous volumetric 
measurements allowed resolution and characterization of 
vortical structures in the wake of a sphere immersed in the 
same boundary layer. The capabilities of the seeding method 
described suggest that it is well suited for various additional 
particle tracking and time-resolved velocimetry techniques 
(Schanz et?al. 2016).
