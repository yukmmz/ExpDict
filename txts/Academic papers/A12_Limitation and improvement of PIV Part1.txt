Abstract. The  deformation  of  particle  image patterns  by  strong 
velocity gradients  and  out-of-pattern  motions is a major source of 
error  for  the  PIV  (Particle  Image  Velocimetry) technique.  This 
deformation is investigated and its effect on conventional PIV tech- 
niques is quantified for 2D flows. Simulations and comparisons with 
independent experiments verify the results. 
1  Introduction 
PIV  is  a  well  known,  effective  technique  for  measuring 
two-dimensional   flow   fields   instantaneously   and   non- 
intrusively.   Since   its   introduction   as   the   laser   speckle 
technique  in  the  1970's  (Barker  and  Fourney  1977,  Sim- 
pkins and  Dudderar  1978), many investigations have been 
carried  out  to  improve  its  performance.  Using  hologra- 
phy,  it   can   also   be   applied   to   three-dimensional  flow 
measurements  (Meng  and  Hussain  1991). 
Typically,  flows  are   seeded  with  microparticles  and 
illuminated  by  a  laser  light  sheet.  If the  particles  are  fine 
enough, their motion follows the flow. Thus, velocity fields 
can  be  obtained  by  measuring  the  motion  of the  visible 
particles.  Usually  PIV  is  distinguished  from  laser  speckle 
velocimetry   and    particle   tracking   velocimetry   by   its 
medium  particle  seeding  concentration  (Adrian  1984). 
There are three major methods for PIV  processing: (1) 
The  Young's   fringe,  (2)  auto-   and   (3)  cross-correlation 
methods.   In   this   paper   we   will   focus  on   studying   the 
cross-correlation technique.  First we will give an overview 
of PIV  techniques.  Thereafter we  will  quantitatively  ana- 
lyze  the   limitations   of  conventional   PIV   due   to   two- 
dimensional  flow  deformations,  i.e.  Ou/Ox, Ou/Oy, Ov/Ox 
and  ~v/~y.  Finally,  simulation  studies  are  carried  out  to 
verify our  results.

2   Principle  of  PIV 
2.1   Young's fringe,  auto-  and cross-correlation   methods 
In   Young's   fringe   method   the   sequentially  double-   or 
multi-exposed  particles  are  first  recorded in  a  single  flow 
picture.   Since  these   particle   images   are   self-correlated, 
Young's   fringes   can   be   used   to   extract   the   velocities 
(Burch  and  Tokarski  1968).  Alternatively  the  whole  pic- 
ture  of the  particle  images  can  be  digitized  and  fed  into 
a  computer  and  the  velocities  can  then  be  obtained  by 
autocorrelation. 
In  such  techniques  particle  images  are  usually  taken 
on  film which  enables  high  resolution measurements  (Liu 
et  al.  1991).  Large  velocities can  thus  be  measured  where 
the  time  interval  between  two  exposures  may  be  very 
small. The associated directional ambiguity (Adrian  1986, 
Grant  and  Liu   1990),  however,  makes  these  techniques 
difficult to apply. A systematic study of these techniques is 
presented  by  Keane  and  Adrian  (1990). 
In  the cross-correlation method,  spatial  cross-correla- 
tions  between  two  sequentially  exposed  flow pictures  are 
used  to  determine  the  velocities (Utami  and  Blackwelder 
1991).  This  technique  removes  the  so  called  directional 
ambiguity  which  is  inherent  in  both  the  Young's  fringe 
and  autocorrelation  techniques. 
An   important   advantage   of  the   video-based  cross- 
correlation   technique   is   its   easy  applicability  for  flow 
velocity measurements  due  to  the  absence  of the  photo- 
graphic and  opto-mechanical processing steps inherent in 
the  non-video-based  PIV  technique  (Willert  and  Gharib 
1991).  However, the  low video framing  rate  and  the  poor 
video  resolution  limit  this  technique  at  present  to  flows 
with  low  speed  and  small  velocity gradients. 
2.2  PIP  (Particle  Image  Pattern)  matching 
For  better  understanding  of the  effect of deformations  of 
flow  on  the  PIV  and  of the  novel  technique  described  in 
169 
the  second  part  of this  paper  we  shall  introduce  another 
concept   for   the   cross-correlation   technique:   the   PIP 
matching. 
PIP  is defined as  an  image  of particles  with  a  certain 
spatial  distribution  in  a  given  space.  A  real  PIP  contains 
randomly distributed particle images of different form and 
gray  value  in  a  noisy background. 
Suppose  we  have  two  separate  sequentially  exposed 
binary flow pictures A and  B (Fig.  1). If we want  to obtain 
the  flow  velocity at  a  given  point  p(x, y)  we  should  first 
select  an  Interrogation  PIP  (IPIP)  centered  at  p(x, y)  in 
the first picture A (Fig.  la). The size of this IPIP  is 2N +  1 
by  2N +  1  (N =  1, 2, 3 . . . .    )  pixels.  For  the  sake  of  sim- 
plicity  we  further  assume   that   the   IPIP   contains   only 
three   particles   forming   a   triangle   PIP   centered   at   its 
middle   point   p(x, y).  This   PIP   has   moved  to   another 
unknown position q(a, b) in the second flow picture B due 
to  the  fluid motion.  In  order to find q(a, b) we also  define 
a  Search  PIP  (SPIP)  with  the  size  of 2 N +   1  by  2 N +   1 
pixels  centering  at  p(x, y)  in  B.  The  PIP  correlated  with 
the IPIP,  i.e. the triangle PIP,  is assumed  to be contained 
in  the  SPIP  (Fig.  lb). 
Now  we let  the  IPIP  scan  sequentially  over the  SPIP 
and  calculate  their  cross-correlation  coefficients.

where  m,  n=   - 2 N ,    - 2 N +     1. . . . .     2N.  l(i,j)  is  the  pixel 
intensity  of the  IPIP;  S(i,j)  is  the  pixel  intensity  of  the 
SPIP  and  S(i,j)=O  when  Iil,  IJI>N. 
When  the  center of the  IPIP  is  moved  to  q(a, b) both 
PIPs  match  fully  resulting  in  a  unique  maximum  cross- 
correlation  peak  R.  The  value  of R  should  be  1  and  its 
location should be q(a, b). Thus  the location q(a, b) can be 
uniquely determined  by finding  the  maximum  value R  in 
the  cross-correlation field obtained  in  Eq.  (1). 
Generally the  location  q(a, b) is a  function of x  and  y. 
Knowing   a(x, y)  and   b(x,y)   and   the   time   interval   At 
between  the  two  exposures  we  obtain  the  flow  velocity

called  PIP  matching. 
3   Deformations of PIP 
In  reality, the  IPIP  will seldom fully match  the  SPIP  due 
to  the  deformation  of PIP  which  is defined as  any  differ- 
ence from the SPIP  to the IPIP. Generally the reasons for 
the  deformation  of PIP  are  due  to: 
(a)  Noise.  Noise  is  always  present  in  images.   It  comes 
usually   with   imaging   (e.g.   dark   noise   of  CCD),   video 
recording  and  image  digitizing  (e.g.  digitizing  error).  It  is 
a  random  function  of time  and  space,  causing  differences 
between  SPIP  and  IPIP. 
(b)  System  error.   System  error  is  the  nonlinear  error  of 
the PIV system usually caused by misalignment of sequen- 
tial  video frames in' case  of video-based  PIV.  It  is  a  func- 
tion  of the  location  and  causes  differences between  SPIP 
and  IPIP. 
(c)  Turbulent flow motions.   Turbulent flow motions result 
in   random   motion   of  seeded  particles   and   will  conse- 
quently   randomize   the   IPIP   and   SPIP.   This   random 
process is beyond the  scope  of this  paper  and  will  not  be 
discussed  here. 
(d)  Out-of-pattern  motions.   Because  of  the  three  dimen- 
sional  flow motion  the particles are not  always  contained 
in  the  two  dimensional  laser  light  sheet.  Out-of-pattern 
motions  occur  when  either  particles  imaged  in  the  IPIP 
move out of the light sheet resulting in the absence of their 
images   in  the   SPIP,   or   when   particles   which   are   not 
imaged  in  the  IPIP   move  into  the  light  sheet  and   are 
imaged   in   the   SPIP.   On   the   other   hand,   even  if  the 
particles   only  move  in   the   light   sheet   in   case   of  two 
dimensional flow they might be imaged only once either in 
the  IPIP  or in  the  SPIP  (Fig.  2) due  to  the limited  size of 
both  PIPs. 
(e)  Flow   velocity   9radients.   Flow   velocity  gradients   in 
two  dimensional  flows are  ~u/Ox, ~3u/~y, ~3v/Ox and  ~3v/~y. 
Because  of these,  the  particles  shown  in  the  IPIP  would 
have  different  velocities  and   therefore  appear  in  a  dis- 
torted pattern in the SPIP.  Figs.  3(a)-(d) demonstrate this 
effect, where the  IPIP  is assumed  to be composed of three 
particle  images. 
Obviously, the deformation of PIP reduces the correlation 
between  IPIP  and  SPIP.  Thus,  in  reality  the  maximum 
cross-correlation  peak  values  R  calculated  from  (1)  are 
170 
always  less  than   1.  We  therefore  define  a  detection  cri- 
terion  R0 in  the  procedure  of PIP matching, i.e.  when  and 
only   when   R>_RO  the   detection   will   be   accepted.   R0 
should   not   be   too   small,   since   otherwise   we   cannot 
distinguish  the  real  cross-correlation  peak  from  the  noise 
peaks,  resulting  in  false  velocity  detections.  The  selection 
of  R0  depends  on  the  quality  of particle  images  and  on 
whether  other  detection  criteria  are  used.  Based  on  our 
results  a  good  empirical  criterion   is  that   R0  should   be 
greater  than  0.5. 
We  define  the  deformation  rate 
o    =    1  -     R .                                                                                                                                       ( 3 )  
Thus,  when  D >  DO =  1 -   R0  the  velocity detection  will  be 
rejected. 
Usually  the  deformation  rate  due  to  the  noise  and  the 
system error is not significant  since noise can be limited by 
improving the  quality  of flow pictures  and  filtered  out  by 
image  pre-processing.  System  error  can  also  be  corrected 
by properly  scaling  the  system  before the  measurement  is 
done.  The  most  troublesome deformations  of PIP  are due 
to  the  out-of-pattern motions  and  velocity gradients  since 
these   depend   on   the   flows   to   be  measured   and   hence 
influence  the  performance  of  PIV.

4.1  Limited velocity  measurement 
due to  out-of-pattern  motions 
Here  we  only  consider  the  out-of-pattern  motions  caused 
by two dimensional flow motions.  Fig. 4 shows the match- 
ed  IPIP  and  SPIP.  We  call  the  overlapping  part  of  the 
IPIP  and  SPIP  the  matched  area  and  the  remaining  part 
mismatched  area. 
Suppose the particle images are densely, randomly and 
well-distributed  in  the  PIP.  Then  from Eqs.  (1) and  (3) we 
can  estimate 
matched   area     mismatched   area 
D ,-- 1 -                              -                                                              (4)

According  to  Eqs.  (2)  and  (4)  the  deformation  rate  Do 
due  to  out-of-pattern  motions  is 
D o l l      ( 2 N + I - L x ) ( 2 N + I - L y )                                              (5)

be  limited  to  the  region  of Do < DO (Fig.  5).  Now  we  can

ment,  we  set  u =  v in  Eq.  (5): 
[C[       ~   (   1   -   ~   )        (2N+  1)M                                         (6)

This limitation,  however, can  be removed  by properly 
selecting  the  size  of SPIP  as  described  below. 
Centered  at  the  same  position  as  the  IPIP  the  SPIP 
has  a  size  of 2K +  1 (K-- 1, 2, 3 . . . .   ) which  is  larger  than 
that  ofthe  IPIP  o f ( 2 N +   1) with  K > N   (Fig.  6). Instead  of 
Eq.  (1) the  cross-correlation  coefficient by the  PIP  match- 
ing  is  then  defined  as

4.2  Limited  vorticity  measurement  due  to  velocity 
gradients 
In  order  to  simplify  the  discussion  we  assume  that  the 
velocity gradients are  constant within the  IPIP.  Thus  the 
deformation rate of a strip of particle images is equivalent 
to that  of the whole PIP  when the strip is in the direction 
of  deformation.  We   assume  further  that   each   particle 
image is a  little square  of b by b pixels  of equal  intensity. 
Under the assumption of Eq. (4) we consider the defor- 
mation  of a  strip  of particle  images  in  the y-direction: its 
length  is  2N +  1 pixels  and  its  width  is  b  pixels  (Fig.  7). 
The deformation rate Duy due to  small Ou/Oy (Fig. 7a), 
i.e.  when  the  maximum  deformation  bias  is 
B"r=(ZN+I)2   8~   A t < b ,  
is obtained  from  Eq.  (4)  to  be 
B,r(ZN+I)     ( 2 N + l )    Ou  At 
O,y-  2(2N +  1)b -        4b        8y       "                                   (9) 
For  large  8u/Sy  (Fig.  7b),  i.e.  when  B,y > b,  then 
bh                               b

For  the deformation rate  Dry due to  By~By,  the  defor- 
mation of the upper and lower half-strips are the same. In 
the  upper   half-strip  we  consider  the  particle  image  of 
number n whose bottom line is at y = nb (Fig. 7c). After the 
deformation it should move to y 1 = nb + nb [Sv/Syl d t. Thus 
the contribution  of this particle  to  Rvy (Roy= 1-Doy)  is 
ARvy(n)     b [ b - ( y l - y ) ]               2b       (        n  8v        ) 
b(2N + l)/2    - ( 2 N + l )       1 -       8y   At    . 
Suppose  m  is  the  first  fully  mismatched  particle  image. 
Usually  rn~> 1  since  the  particle  image  size  b  is  much 
smaller than  the  IPIP  size,  thus

5  Simulation studies 
In order to confirm the assumptions  made  in  Eqs. (5) and 
(14)  computer  simulations  were  carried  out.  Instead   of 
photographing  the  particle-seeded  flow,  particle  images 
were  artificially  generated  by  Monte  Carlo  simulation. 
They  were  distributed  with  high  seeding  concentration 
randomly in a  x-y plane.  Each  particle image is described 
by b x b pixels with  the  same  pixel intensity satisfying the 
assumptions  for Eqs.  (5)  and  (14).

Fig. 9.  a and b.  Comparison between the predicted  and  the simulated results of deformation  rate  due to (a) ~u/Oy and (b) Ov/Oy for various 
IPIP size (2N + 1 =21,  31, 41) and  various  particle  image size (b = 1, 2, 3) 
5.1  Deformation  rate due  to  out-of-pattern  motions 
In this  simulation  all particle  images in  the  simulated  first 
exposed   flow   picture   A   were   displaced   artificially   by 
(Lx, Ly) resulting in  the second exposed flow picture  B. In 
the conventional  technique,  i.e. the SPIP in B has the same 
size as the  IPIP  in  A, the  deformation  rates  Do of the  PIP 
due  to  out-of-pattern  motions  for  various  I P I P   sizes,  i.e. 
2 N + 1 = 2 1 ,      31   and   41,   were   calculated   according   to 
Eqs.  (1)  and  (3). 
Fig.  8  shows  that  the  simulation  results  are  in  good 
agreement  with  the  prediction  of Eq.  (5)  for  the  cases  (a) 
Ly = 0  and  (b)  Lx = Ly. 
5.2  Deformation  rate due  to  velocity  gradients 
In  this  case  the  second  exposed  flow  picture  B  was  ob- 
tained  by artificially deforming the simulated first exposed 
flow  picture  A.  IPIPs  with  sizes  of  21,  31  and  41  were 
selected  and  the  various  sizes  of particle  image  b  (b =  1, 2 
and   3)  were  considered.   The  SPIP  in  B  is  in  the  same 
position  as  the  I P I P   in  A,  but  has  a  large  enough  size  to 
satisfy  the  criterion  Eq.  (8),  assuming  deformation  due  to 
the  out-of-pattern  motions  will  not  occur. 
Figs.  9(a)  and  (b)  show  the  good  agreement  between 
the  simulation  results  and  the  predictions  of Eq.  (14)  for 
various  Ou/Oy and  3v/Oy. 
The  analysis  of  deformation  rates  due  to  Ou/Ox and 
Ov/dx  are  similar  and  are  therefore  not  presented  here. 
ment  the  size of I P I P   was  31  x  31  pixels, the  time between 
two frames was  1/30  seconds.  The  particle  image  size was 
about  2 x 2  pixels  and  the  system  scale  factor  was  about 
0.2 mm/pixel.  The  detection  criterion  was  assumed  to  be 
0.5  since  it  was  not  explicitly  given. 
Putting  these values into  Eqs. (6) and (15) we obtain  an 
estimated  maximum  measurable  velocity  and  vorticity  of 
5.6 cm/s  and  1.9 s-1,  respectively, as  compared  to  the  mea- 
sured  maximum  velocity  and  vorticity  of about  3.3 cm/s 
and  1 s- 1 found  by  Willert  and  Gharib. 
7  Conclusions 
The limitations  of conventional  PIV due to velocity gradi- 
ents   and   out-of-pattern   motions   are   quantitatively   de- 
rived  in  this  work  by  analyzing  the  deformations  of  the 
PIP.  The  results  agree  well  with  the  simulation  results. 
Although  the  estimates  are  made  with  the  simplifying 
assumptions  that  the  deformation  rate  is constant  within 
the   PIP   and   that   particle   images   are   squares   of  b   by 
b  pixels  with  the  same  intensity,  they  are  still  useful  for 
determining   the   system   parameters   when   doing   PIV 
measurements.  Comparison  with  the  experimental  results 
of Willert  and  Gharib  (1991)  shows  the  realiability  of the 
estimates. 
6  Comparison with experiment 
The  estimates  of the  limitations  of conventional  PIV  de- 
scribed  in   Eqs.  (6)  and   (15)   are  in   agreement   with   the 
experiment  of Willert  and  Gharib  (1991).  In  their  experi-
