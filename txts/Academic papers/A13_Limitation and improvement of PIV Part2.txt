Abstract. In this second part of the paper, the Particle Image Distor- 
tion  (PID) technique  is described.  It  is  proposed  to  overcome  the 
limitations of conventional  PIV due to the local deformations Ou/Ox, 
~u/~y, ~v/?x and  ~v/Oy in two-dimensional  flows. Both  simulation 
and  experiment  demonstrate  that  high  accuracy  and  high  spatial 
resolution  are possible with this technique. The large time required 
to compute the cross-correlations,  however, limits its wide applica- 
tions  at present. 
1   Introduction 
To   perform  PIV  measurements  in  flows  with   large  ve- 
locity  gradients,  it  may  be  necessary  to  reduce  the  detec- 
tion  criterion   R0,  i.e.  the  lower  threshold   value  for  the 
cross-correlation  peak  values  (see  Part  I),  to  select  large 
seeding  particles  in  order  to  obtain  large  particle  images, 
to reduce the  PIP size N  and  to reduce the time interval At 
between  subsequent  exposures. 
This,  however,  introduces   other  problems.  Reducing 
R0  increases  the  probability  of  false  velocity  detections. 
Too   large  seeding  particles   may  disturb   the  flow  itself. 
Furthermore,  large  particle  image  size  broadens  the  cor- 
relation   peak   and   hence   reduces   the   accuracy  of  peak 
detection.   The   selection   of  N   usually   depends   on   the 
spatial  resolution  and  on  the  particle  seeding  concentra- 
tion   (Utami   and   Blackwelder   1990,   Keane   and   Adrian 
1990). 
A  compromise  is  therefore  needed.   The  best  choice 
seems  to  be  reducing  At,  although   the  relative  error  in 
regions  of low  speed  flow is then  increased.  This choice is 
not   available   in   video-based   PIV   at   present,   since   the 
standard  video framing rate is fixed at a  low value (Willert 
and  Gharib  1991). 
The  novel  PID  technique  proposed in  this  paper  over- 
comes such a limitation inherent  in conventional  PIV. For 
the  sake  of simplicity we  will  consider  only  deformations 
in   two   dimensional   flow,   i,e.   Ou/Ox, ~?u/Oy, ~?v/~?x and

Ov/~?y. It  is  also  assumed  that  the  effect of  out-of-pattern 
motions  is  already  removed  with  a  larger  SPIP  (Search 
PIP)  size than  that  of I P I P   (Interrogation  PIP),  cf. part  I 
of the  paper  (Huang  et  al.  1993). 
2   PID,  a  way  to  reduce  the  effect  of  deformations 
2.1   The  basic  idea 
According   to   general   kinematics   we  divide   the   overall 
flow  motion  into  three  parts: 
flow  motion = convection  (translation)  + stretch + rotation. 
(1) 
Stretch  (expressed  by  ~u/c?x and  ?v/~?y) and  rotation 
(expressed  by ~u/Oy and  Ov/~?x) constitute  the  total  defor- 
mation  of PIP  (Particle  Image  Pattern). 
The  translation  has  no  contribution  to  the  deforma- 
tion  of  PIP.  Given  the  velocity  gradients  we  can  artifici- 
ally  distort  the  I P I P   to  its  shape  which  it  would  have  if 
only  translation  were  present.  We  denote  this  as  Particle 
Image  Distortion  (PID).  This  distorted  IPIP  should  then 
fully.match   the   SPIP,   resulting   in   a   maximum   cross- 
correlation  peak  value  of R =  1. 
2.2   The artificial distortion  of IPIP 
Let l(x, y) to be the pixel intensity in the I P I P  where x and 
y are pixel coordinates  with their origin in the center of the 
IPIP. Considering  the local flow deformations, the pixel at 
(x,y)  in   the   IPIP   should   be,   as   a   first   approximation, 
changed  to  (xs, Ys) in  the  distorted  I P I P  
f                     ~?u      ~?u  "~ At 
{ 3v       3v   "~ At     '                                              (2) 
Y~= Y + ~ x X   +~yY)-~ 
where  M  is  the  system  scale  constant. 
264 
In  general,  however,  xs  and  Ys are  not  integer  values, 
i.e.  no  pixel  in  the  distorted  IPIP  corresponds  exactly to 
I(x, y). Usually four pixels neighboring (Xs, Ys) are  used to 
describe  I (x, y)  satisfying 
xs=  ~=1l4i xi /  I(x, y) 
i 
Ys=  ~Iiyi    I(x,y)     ,                                            (3) 
i 
4. 
I(x, y)  =  ~  li 
i = l  
where  Ii and  (xi, Yi), i=  1, 2,  3, 4,  are  the  pixel  intensities 
and  coordinates  of these  four  pixels,  respectively. 
Supposing 
f  Xs=Xo+dx 
Y~= Yo +  dy   '                                                                     (4) 
where  Xo  and  Yo  are  integers,  dx  and  dyE[O,  1].  Thus 
according   to   Eqs.   (3)   and   (4)  the   pixel   locations   and 
intensities  of  these  four  pixels  in  the  distorted  IPIP  for 
I(x, y)  should  be 
I 1Il(Xl,Yl)=II(xo,  Yo)             =I(x,y)'(1-dx)'(1-dy) 
t 2(Xz,yz)=Iz(xo,Yo+  1)       =l(x,y)'(1  -dx)'dy 
I3(x3,)3)=13(Xo+  1,yo)       =I(x,y)   dx'(1-dy) 
L I4(x4, Y4) = 14(Xo +  1, Yo +  1) = l(x, y)  dx" dy 
( 5 )  
Since distorting the IPIP simultaneously broadens the 
pixel  of  the  IPIP,  particle  images  in  the  distorted  IPIP 
might  overlap.  In  order  not  to  lose  information of pixels 
processed  before, the history of each pixel in the distorted 
IPIP must be added. If the new contribution is I~, and the 
history  is  I~o, then  finally the  pixel  intensities  in  the  dis- 
torted  IPIP  for each  pixel  in  the  IPIP  are 
l~(x,,y~)=Ii,(x,,yi)+I~o(X~,y~),     i=1,  2,  3, 4.                 (6) 
Usually  the  distorted  IPIP  no  longer  has  the  square 
shape of the IPIP.  Nevertheless, a square IPIP is required 
for  a  simple  computation  of cross-correlations.  To  solve 
this problem, a larger temporary PIP containing the IPIP 
in the center is first distorted. Then the square center part 
of  this  distorted  temporary  PIP  is  cut  out  for  the  final 
distorted  IPIP  (Fig.  1). 
Figure  2  summarizes  the  whole  procedure  of artifici- 
ally distorting the  IPIP. 
2.3  Determination  of the flow  deformations 
The artificial distortion of PIP  requires an a priori knowl- 
edge  of the  flow velocity gradients  within  the  whole flow 
field. An initial estimate of the velocity field is obtained by

obtain  estimates  at  points  where  the  conventional  PIV 
fails,  e.g. in  regions with  strong  velocity gradients. 
Figure 3 shows a representative velocity field detected 
with  conventional  PIV.  The  velocities in  the  hatched  re- 
gions are not detected because of strong velocity gradients 
there.  The  region  of failed velocity detections (e.g.  region 
A) is denoted as closed if the velocities along its boundary 
are  known,  otherwise  it  is  called  as  open  (e.g. region  B 
and  C). 
In  the  closed  region  A  the  interpolation  of a  velocity 
component  c(x, y),  c(x, y) = {u (x, y),  v (x, y);  (x, y) e A},  is 
suggested to  be  obtained  by  weighing the  horizontal  and 
vertical linear interpolations cn and  Cv according to their 
interpolation lengths, i.e. x2 -x~  for cn and Y2 -Yl  for Cv: 
C(X,y)=            Y2--Yl 
(x2--Xl)+(y2--Yl)  CH(X'Y) 
X  2  - - X      1 
(x2-x~)+(y2-y~)  Cv(x,y) 
c.(x,y)= C(x2'y)--C(XI'Y) (x__x1)+C(XI,y ) 
X  2  - - X      1

Thus  the  velocity gradients  are  estimated as

region. 
2.4   Iteration 
Despite  the  fact  that  results  from  Eqs.  (7)  and  (8)  do  not 
exactly reflect the  velocity gradients  of the  flow, they  are 
applied  to  artificially  distorting  the  IPIP.  This  velocity 
detection  with   conventional  technique  is  called   as   the 
initial  step  of PID. 
In   the   first   velocity  detection   of  PID,   correlations 
between  the  distorted  PIPs  and  SPIPs  are  implemented. 
Of course,  such  a  distorted  IPIP  cannot  be  expected  to 
fully  match   the  deformed  SPIP.   Nevertheless,  the   PIP 
should  match  better  because  the  result  from  Eq.  (8)  in- 
cludes the effects of the flow velocity gradients.  As a  result 
of that, maximum  correlations should become higher. The 
estimate of the velocities obtained at this time will then be 
better than  that  obtained  initially with conventional PIV. 
Iterating  with  PID  on  this  first  detection  will  give an 
improved estimate  of the  velocities. The  whole  procedure 
is completed  when  the  iteration  converges within  a  given 
tolerance, i.e. when  the  maximum  difference between  two 
sequential   velocity  detections   is   smaller   than   a   given 
threshold. 
For  the  open  regions  B  and  C  it is  necessary to  close 
them  first.  For  regions  like  B  the  open  boundary  can  be 
closed  by  a   linear  interpolation  between   the   two   side 
points,  i.e.  B1  and  B2,  on  the  open  boundary.  Thus  B  is 
also  considered  as  quasi-closed    region.  For  regions  like 
C  the velocity at the corner C3  should be determined first. 
Usually  it  is  replaced  by  the  correctly  detected  velocity 
closest  to  C3.  These  regions  can   then  be  closed   using 
3   P I D    applied  to  a  simulated  Oseen-vortex 
When  the  vortex core is located in  the  origin  the  velocity 
distribution  of the  Oseen  vortex  in  polar  coordinate  sys- 
tem  is 
f C ~ = ~ - - ~ r ( 1 - e - ' 2 / 4 ~ '     ) 
C , = 0                                  '                                                        (9) 
266 
and  its  vorticity  is 
[~        _rZ14v t 
Q :    =    4rivet  e                                                                                                                              (lO) 
where  F  is the  circulation,  v is the  flow viscosity and  t  the 
time.  For  t = 0   the  vorticity  is  concentrated  in  the  vortex 
core.  With  t  increasing,  the  vorticity  is no  longer  concen- 
trated  in  the  core  but  decays  and  spreads  out  (Albring 
1981,   Fiedler  et  al.   1991).   Selecting  different  parameters 
F  and  v t ,    vortices with different  vorticity and  different size 
can  be  generated. 
Supposing  first  exposed  flow  picture  contains  particle 
images generated  from Monte-Carlo-Simulation  (part I  of 
the  paper).  Each  particle  image  in  the  first  exposed  flow 
picture  is  then  displaced  according  to  Eq.  (9)  resulting  in        a 
the   second   exposed   flow   picture.   In   case   of   vt=200 
[pixel] 2 and  F =  100000  [pixel]2/s  the vorticity near to the 
vortex  core  is  very  strong,  namely  39.79  s-1.  Thus  direct 
velocity detections  with  conventional  technique  in  case  of 
A t    =  1/50 s fail for this  region  (Fig. 4a. Note that  in Figs. 4, 
6 and  8 only  one  of each  four  velocities is plotted  in  order 
to  have  a  clear  view  of  the  velocity  field).   In  this  special 
case  the  I P I P   size  was  31  x  31  pixels,  the  particle  image 
size  was  1 x  1 pixel,  i.e.  b =  1. 
We  now   introduce   a   detection   criterion   R0.  All  ve- 
locities  whose  maximum  correlation  peak  value  R >  R0 
are accepted  to  be correct (Fig.  4b). In  this  special case R0 
can  be  a  small  value  of  0.2  (see  also  Fig.   14a)  since  the 
signal  to  noise  ratio  in  the  cross-correlation  field  is  quite 
large where  b =  1 and  the  particle  seeding concentration  is 
sufficiently  large.  From  these  correct  velocities  the  failed 
velocities   were   interpolated   according   to   Eq.   (7).  The 
b 
whole  velocity  field  was  then  smoothed  (Fig.  4c)  before 
calculating  the  velocity gradients  since the  differentiations 
in   Eq.   (8)   are   sensitive   to   high   frequency   noise.   Fig- 
ure  5   shows   the   comparison   between   the   real   velocity 
profiles  of  the   simulated   Oseen   vortex   and   the   results 
obtained  in  the  initial  step  of  PID. 
As  described  in  Sect.  2 the  velocity gradients  obtained 
from  Fig.  4c  were  used  for artificially  distorting  the  IPIP. 
The  spatial  cross-correlation  between  the  distorted  IPIP 
and  SPIP  is then recalculated,  giving the first PID velocity 
detection  (Figs.  6  and  7). 
Under  identical  detection  criterion,  the  PID  results  in 
Fig.  6b give more correct velocity vectors in the core of the 
Oseen  vortex than  the  conventional  PIV results in Fig. 4b. 
Similarly,  the  agreement  between  the  PID  and  the  theo- 
retical results in Fig.  7 is much better than  that for conven- 
tional   PIV  in  Fig.  5  (note  that  the  plots  in  Fig.  5a  and 
Fig.  7a  have  different  vertical  scale),                                                 e 
The  results  improve with  further  iteration,  converging 
to  within  about  ten  percent  after  the  fourth  iteration.  The 
"converged"  results  are  shown  in  Figs.  8  and  9.

4.1   Computation  time 
Calculating  the  cross-correlation  coefficients is  the  most 
time-consuming  with  the  time  a  function  of the  sizes  of 
IPIP  and  SPIP.  For the typical IPIP  size of 31 ?  31 pixels 
and  the  SPIP  size  of 71 ?  71  pixels  the  calculation  takes 
about  4  seconds  on  the  Apollo-Workstation  DN10000 
which  runs  about  20  times  faster  than  a  personal  com- 
puter. Thus for a complete evaluation of a  velocity field of 
the  size  512 ?  512  pixels  the  computation  time  required 
would  be  about  12  days  for  only one  iteration  step! 
There  are  two  major  possibilities  to  reduce  the  time 
consumption.   First,   reducing   the   number   of  detection 
points,  i.e. detecting velocities over a  certain  grid  spacing 
rather   than   at   every  pixel.  This   method,   however,  in- 
creases  the  error  of velocity detection  (see  Sects.  4.2  and 
4.5).  Second,  reducing  the  size  of  SPIP  in  the  iteration 
since velocities obtained  in  the  previous step  can  be  used 
to predict the location of SPIP. Note that  the size of SPIP 
in the initial  step must  be large enough  to avoid the  effect 
of out-of-pattern motions  (Huang  et  al.  1993). 
For  this  reason,  only velocities over a  grid  spacing  of 
5  pixels  in  a  255 ?  255  pixels  field  were  detected  in  the 
simulation  measurement.  In  the initial  step  the  size of the 
IPIP  was   31 x  31   pixels  and   the  size  of  the   SPIP   was 
71 ?         pixel.   The   computation   time   was   then   about 
3  hours.   In  the  later  iteration  processes  the  size  of  the 
SPIP  was   reduced  to  41  ?  41   pixel.  Consequently  each 
successive  iteration  took  only  about  0.7  hours.  The  total 
time   for   the   complete   computation   was   then   about 
7  hours  (CPU  time). 
4.2   Error  analysis  1 -   validity  of the  linear  interpolation 
From  Fig.  9a  we  find  that  the  maximum  detection  error 
occurs  not  at  the  vortex  core  where  the  vorticity  has  its 
maximum  but  at  the  location  where  the  gradient  of the 
vorticity  is  largest.  This  problem  is  due  to  the  fact  that 
linear  interpolations  were  supplemented  for  the  undetec- 
ted  velocities when  calculating  the  velocity gradients. 
Obviously this approximation is only acceptable when 
the  detected  velocities are  dense  enough  so  that  the  vari- 
ation  of velocity can  be  assumed  to  be  linear  among  the 
neighboring detected velocities. Near the vortex core (r---,0 
in  Fig.  9) the variation  of velocity is approximately linear 
between  the  grid  spacing  of  5  pixels  of the  detected  ve- 
locities.  Thus  the  error  of the  measured  velocities in  this 
region  is  rather  small.  In  the  area  of the  largest  vorticity

gradient  (r ~  36  pixels),  however,  the  variation  of velocity 
can  no  longer  be  assumed  to  be  linear.   As  a  result  the 
errors  in  this  region  are  larger. 
A way to improve the performance is that in the  region 
of large  gradients  higher  order  interpolations  rather  than 
the  linear  interpolation  suggested  in  this  paper  might  be 
used.  If  this  works  the  time  consumption  for  the  same 
accuracy of velocity detection can be reduced  by detecting 
the  velocity over a  larger grid  spacing, since  the  computa- 
tion  of  a  higher  order  interpolation,   e.g.   the  2nd   order 
interpolation,  should  be considerably faster than  the com- 
putation   of  the   correlations.   Further   discussion   of  this 
problem  is  beyond  the  scope  of this  paper. 
4.3  Error analysis 2 -      boundary effect 
The  differentiations   in   Eq.   (8)  required   to   estimate  the 
velocity  gradients   are   very  sensitive   to   high   frequency 
noise.   The   detected   and   subsequently   interpolated   ve- 
locity  fields  should  therefore  be  smoothed  before  further 
processing.  The  size  of the  smoothing  window  is  usually 
11?        to  21? 
For  smoothing  close to  the  boundary  of the  data  base 
the  size of the  smoothing  window  has  to  be reduced  since 
no  data  exist beyond  the  boundary.  Thus  the  noise  of the 
detected   velocities  cannot   be  significantly  reduced  near 
the  boundary  of the  data  base. 
Figures   9  and   11  demonstrate   this  boundary   effect: 
For  the  data  base  of  255  ?  255  pixels  (Fig.  9)  the  corre- 
sponding  boundary  of r =  127  pixels  is  the  region  where 
the  error   increases,   while   for  a   data   base   of  161  ?  161 
pixels  the  error  increases  at  the  corresponding  boundary 
of r =  80  pixels  (Fig.  11). 
To   avoid   this   boundary   effect  the   area   of  interest 
should  be restricted to the internal  regions of the database 
(usually more than  the  IPIP  size from the  boundary).  The 
measurement  area  is  then  however  reduced. 
4.4  Error analysis 3 -      limitation  of accuracy 
The  accuracy  velocity  detections  is  limited  by  the  peak 
locating  accuracy.  Since  the  database  is  discrete  an  inter- 
polation  is required  to  locate the  maximum cross-correla- 
tion peak to sub-pixel accuracy. Fig.  10 shows the result of 
velocity  detections  in  which  the  IPIP  is  distorted  by  the 
real   velocity   gradients   of  the   simulated   Oseen-vortex. 
Using  the  simplest  peak  locating  method,  i.e.  the  center- 
of-mass  method,  the  absolute  error  is  about  0.25  pixels.

According to Willert  and  Gharib  (1991) better  peak  locat-

fit  method. 
4.5  Spatial  resolution  of PID 
The  use  of P I D   improves  the  spatial  resolution  of conven- 
tional  PIV. 
In  conventional  PIV  techniques  the  spatial  resolution 
of PIV  depends  on  the  size  of the  I P I P   since  the  detected 
velocity  is  the  mean   velocity  of  each  particle  within  the 
I P I P   (Keane  and  Adrian  1990,  Willert  and  Gharib   1991). 
The   smaller  the  size  of  the  IPIP,  the  higher  the  spatial 
resolution  obtained.  Usually  the  size  of I P I P   must  not  be 
too  small  because  sufficient particle  images  must  be  avail- 
able  within. 
In   the   P I D    technique   the   imaged   velocity   field   is 
artificially  and  iteratively  homogenized.  Each  pixel  in  the

Fig.   12a  and  b.   The  s m o o t h e d   result  of the  high  spatial  resolution 
m e a s u r e m e n t   over  the .smoothed  window  with  the  size  of 31  pixels: 
the  velocity  profiles  of a  Cr   and  b  C, 
IPIP  is  relocated  as  if there  were  no  velocity gradients  in 
the  flow field. As  a  result,  the  IPIP  size will not  influence 
the  accuracy of the  velocities if the  IPIP  contains  enough 
particle  images.  The  spatial  resolution  hence  depends  on 
the accuracy of the pixel relocation, which in turn depends 
on the accuracy of the velocity gradients calculated. Using 
linear  interpolation for undetected velocities as  suggested 
in  this  paper  the  spatial  resolution  should  ultimately  de- 
pend  on  the  grid  spacing  over  which  velocities  are  de- 
tected. Ideally, spatial resolutions of up to one pixel can be 
obtained. 
Velocities plotted as dots  in Fig.  11 were detected over 
a  grid  spacing  of  1 pixel,  with  the  size  of IPIP  of 3t  x  31 
pixels.  This   result   is  obviously  much   better   than   that 
shown  in  Figs  9c  and  9d  which  is  detected  over  a  grid 
spacing  of  5  pixels.  It  is  found  that  velocities  at  r ~ 3 6  
pixels  where  the  velocity spatial  frequency is  of the  order 
of the  size  of  IPIP  can  still  be  correctly detected.  If  the 
spatial   resolution  were  the   size  of  IPIP,   i.e.   31   pixels, 
the  detected  velocities would  have  been  smoothed  within 
the IPIP.  This smoothed  result has large errors where the 
velocity spatial  frequency is  high  (Fig.  12). 
4.6  The  dependence  of detected  velocities 
As  described  above,  the  high  accuracy  and  high  spatial 
resolution  of PID  usually  require  a  large  overlap in  each 
direction of the IPIP.  Furthermore,  the interpolation  and 
iteration of PID  also require the knowledge of neighbour- 
ing velocities. Thus  the detected velocities of PID  are  not 
fully independent. 
4.7  Cross-correlation  fields 
As a  reference four cross-correlation fields were plotted in 
Fig.   13  in  which  correlations  less  than  zero  were  set  to 
zero.  In  the  region  of  large  velocity  gradients,  with  e.g. 
r = 40  pixels, the  maximum  correction peak  evaluated  by 
the  conventional  technique  was  only  slightly  higher  than 
the  noise  peak  (Fig.   13a),  whereas  a  strong  correlation 
peak  was  obtained  with  the  PID  technique  (Fig.  13b).  In 
the  region  of extremely large  velocity gradients,  as  e.g.  at 
the  vortex  core  of  r =0 ,    the  real  maximum   correlation 
peak  could  not  be  detected  by  the  conventional  method 
(Fig.  13c), whereas  a  significant  correlation peak  was  still 
found  with  the  PID  technique  (Fig.  13d).

measurements  of a  water flow downstream  of a  backward 
facing  step.  This  flow  is  difficult  to  measure  because  of 
the  flow  separations  and  reattachments,  backward  flow 
motions  and  their  interactions  with  the  oncoming  flow, 
the  interaction  between  flow and  the  wall,  the  large  pres- 
sure gradients  and  the large velocity gradients (Eaton and 
Johnston   1981).  Until  now  our  theoretical  knowledge  of 
these  flows is  limited  and  experimental  investigations  are 
the  most  promising  for  their  understanding. 
A  video-based  PIV-system  was  used  to  measure  the 
flow since  its  sequential  video images  enable  the  study  of 
unsteady flows. Flow pictures were taken by a  CCD  video 
camera with a resolution of 512 x  512 pixels and a framing 
rate  of 25 Hz.  For  such  a  hardware  configuration,  how- 
ever,  the  conventional  technique  can  only  be  applied  to 
flows at speeds of about 4.6 cm/s in liquids and  with small 
velocity  gradient   of  about   1.6 s -1   (Willert  and   Gharib 
1991;  Huang  et  al.  1993). 
Here  the  PID  technique  shows  its  power.  Analyzing 
two  sequential  video  fields  with  the  time  interval  1/50 s 
instead   of  analyzing  two   sequential   video  frames  with 
the  time  interval  1/25  s  the  maximum  measured  vorticity 
in  this  example  is  55.3  s-1.  It  should  be  noted  that  the 
spatial  resolution  is  reduced  by  a  factor of 2  when  video 
fields  rather  than  video  frames  are  analyzed. 
Theoretically no  limitation  for maximum  measurable 
velocity of the  outside  potential  flow  is  given.  Neverthe- 
less,  if the  velocity  of the  potential  flow  is  too  large  the 
turbulent-  and  the  three  dimensional  flow  motions  and 
the velocity gradients  behind  the  step  become excessively 
large and  hence limit the possibility of correctly detecting 
the  velocities.  In  this  example  the  maximum   measured 
velocity of the  potential flow was  about  20 cm/s,  thus  the 
Reynolds  number  based  on  the  step  height  (2 cm)  was 
about  Re = 4000. 
Figure   14  depicts  some   of  the  results   obtained.   In 
order to reduce the false velocity detections another detec- 
tion criterion R1, i.e. the ratio of the maximum correlation 
peak value R to the second highest correlation peak  value 
was  introduced  for  each  velocity  detection  (Keane  and 
Adrian  1991). Using the conventional technique the detec- 
ted  velocities  in  the  vortex  region  with  strong  velocity 
gradients are almost all erroneous (Fig.  14a). For a  higher 
detection threshold the detection of velocities in the vortex 
region   fails  due   to   the   strong   local   velocity  gradients 
(Fig.  14c). The  application  of the  new  technique  provides

Fig.  14a-d.  Comparison between  results  as  obtained with  the  conventional (left, a  and c) and  the  PID  technique (right,  b and d) for  the 
measurement of the  water  flow downstream of a  backward facing step  with  various detection  criteria  R and R1 
better  results:  the  detected  velocities  in  the  vortex  region 
become  reasonable  (Fig.  14b).  Compared  with  Figs.  14c 
and   14d  many  more  velocities  in  the  vortex  region  are 
correctly  detected  with  the  same  detection  criteria. 
6  Conclusions 
PI D   is  an  effective  way  to  overcome  the  limitations  of 
conventional  PIV  due  to  deformations.  It  improves  the 
accuracy  and  spatial  resolution of PIV  systems.  It  shows 
special promise in video-based PIV,  where  the  time  inter- 
val  between  two  sequential exposures  is  large. 
This   technique,  however,   requires   enough   correctly 
detectable   velocities   with   the   conventional  technique. 
Furthermore,  large  computation  time  currently limits  its 
wide  application.
