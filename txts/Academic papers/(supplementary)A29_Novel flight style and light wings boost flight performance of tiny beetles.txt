Section 1 – Body size measurements 
It was not possible to measure the body mass of Paratuposa placentis 
Deane,  1931  directly,  because  the  total  mass  of  all  specimens  was  less 
than the lower capacity of the laboratory balance. Therefore, P. placentis 
body mass was calculated based on the body mass of the closely related 
beetle  Primorskiella sp.,  which  has  a similar  body  size  and  proportions 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). A total of 179 Primorskiella sp. specimens were 
immobilized by carbon dioxide and weighed on a Satrogosm МВ210-А 
laboratory  balance  (Satrogosm  LLC,  Russia).  Their  total  weight  was 
0.82 mg,  and  therefore  the  mean  weight  of  one  specimen  was  4.58  µg. 
Confocal  stacks  of  10  specimens  of  each  species  were  obtained  by 
Olympus FV10i-O (Olympus Corporation, Japan), using autofluorescence 
in  channels  of  488  and  559  nm  lasers.  The  samples  were  depigmented 
using  hydrogen  peroxide  solution  (Dimethyl  sulfoxide  +  100%  EtOH  + 
30%  H2O2  in  proportions  1 + 3 + 1,  respectively)  for  1–5  days  at  a 
temperature  of  37  °С.  Then  the  samples  were  dehydrated  in  ethanol 
solutions  of  increasing  concentrations  (80,  95,  100,  and  100%)  and 
clarified  in  BABB  (Benzyl  Alcohol  +  Benzyl  Benzoate  in  proportions 
1 + 2) for 24 hours. Preparations with the samples were made using two 
cover glasses and FEP ring spacers. Body reconstructions were built from 
confocal stacks in Bitplane Imaris using Surface function and automatic 
image    segmentation    (Supplementary    Fig.    1).    Volumes    of    body 
reconstructions  were  measured  in  the  statistical  module  of  the  Imaris 
program.  The  body  volume  of  Primorskiella  sp.  was  5.33  ±  0.16  nL 
(hereinafter M ± s.d.); its density was therefore 0.86 ± 0.02 µg/nL. The 
body volume of P. placentis was 2.83 ± 0.22 nL. Assuming that the body 
density  of  both  species  is  equal,  the  body  mass  of  P.  placentis  is  
2.43 ± 0.19 µg.

Primorskiella sp. b, Paratuposa placentis. 
The body length of each living specimen was measured in high-speed 
recordings as the distance between the anterior edge of the head and the 
posterior  edge  of  the  abdomen.  The  three-dimensional  body  length  was 
calculated based on lengths it two orthogonal projections. The values in 
frame  sequences  (from  21  to  106)  were  averaged  for  each  recording. 
The  average  body  length  of  all  recorded  specimens  was  395  ±  21  μm. 
The body length measured by confocal stacks was 375 ± 1 2 μm.  Thus, 
the  body  length  of  living  specimens  was  higher  than  that  of  fixed  ones 
(Mann–Whitney  U  test,  p  <  0.01),  probably  because  of  contraction  of 
intersegment   abdominal   muscles   after   fixation.   In   this   connection, 
we calculated the body mass of the recorded beetles taking into account 
the   changes   in   their   body   shape.   The   body   mass   of   the   recorded 
specimens  in  kg  was  estimated  using  the  formula  mb  =  ρKisolb3,  where
Kiso = 45.95, ρ = 0.86 kg/m3 and lb is the in-flight body length in m.
Section 2 – Wing morphometrics 
Ten dissected wing preparations were manufactured according to the 
protocol    described    in    our    previous    study1.    The    morphometric 
characteristics (wing length, total wing area and area of the membranous 
part  plus  petiole)  were  measured  in  Autodesk  AutoCAD,  using  images 
taken with a light microscope. 
Section 3 – Allometric analysis of wing mass 
In this section, we compare our wing mass calculations with available 
mass measurement data. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows the wing mass mw 
plotted    against    the    wing    area    S    for    a    variety    of    insects. 
Direct  measurements  are  scarce  for  wings  of  areas  less  than  10  mm2. 
Therefore, the allometric trends are extrapolated down to S = 0.118 mm2 
in order to compare with P. placentis. Extrapolation of the general trend 
yields mw = 0.115 µg, which is close to the estimate obtained assuming a 
0.73  µm-thick  membrane.    The  value  based  on  the  trend  for  desiccated 
Staphylinoidea wings is  mw = 0.066 µg, which is expectedly lower, but 
not as low as mw of the bristled wing.  
Sources2,3,4,5,6    report  multiple  measurements  of  individual  samples. 
The  points  in  Extended  Data  Fig.  1  are  the  corresponding  averages  for 
each  species  and  each  source.  In  addition,  in  the  cases  where  the  wing 
data   are   presented   in   a   dimensionless   form2,   we   recovered   the 
dimensional   parameters   before   calculating   the   respective   averages. 
For Glossina spp. (tsetse flies)7, allometric relationship is reported for mw
as  a  function  of  2S.  Extended  Data  Fig.  1  contains  only  two  extreme 
points  on  it  that  correspond  to  the  smallest  and  the  largest  tsetse  fly 
wings,  respectively.  For  the  small  wasp  Nasonia  vitripennis  (Walker, 
1836),  the  wing  area  measurements  have  been  published,  but  the  wing 
mass data remained unpublished8. The Drosophila wing mass9 is a result 
of a calculation rather than a direct measurement. All points in Extended 
Data Fig. 1 correspond to the area and the mass of one wing, except for 
the Hymenoptera species, in which case a point corresponds to a single 
forewing-hindwing pair. 
In addition to the published data, measurements of the wing area and 
mass  of  seven  species  of  Staphylinoidea  (the  superfamily  containing 
Ptiliidae)   were   taken:   Staphylinidae:   Lordithon   lunulatus   (Linnaeus, 
1760), Philonthus sp. and Aleochara sp.; Silphidae: Nicrophorus vespillo 
(Linnaeus,   1758),   N.   investigator   (Zetterstedt,   1824),   N.   humator 
(Gleditsch,  1767)  and  Oiceoptoma  thoracicum  (Linnaeus,  1758).  The 
material was taken from the collection of the Department of Entomology, 
Faculty  of  Biology,  Lomonosov  Moscow  State  University.  Dry  wings 
were weighed on a Satrogosm MV210-A laboratory balance (Satrogosm 
LLC, Russia) at a temperature of 25 °C and a relative humidity of 50%. 
Wings  of  the  larger beetles  were weighed  separately;  small  wings were 
weighed   in   several   pieces.   To   measure   the   wing   area,   temporary 
microscopic  preparations  of  the  straightened  wings  in  glycerol  were 
made; they were photographed on an Olympus SZX16 microscope with a 
Canon 1000D camera. The area measurement was performed in the same 
way as described in SI 2. 
Section 4 – Wing deformations 
For evaluation of transverse wing  deformations, we selected frames 
that    showed    the    wing    in    lateral    view    during    power    strokes 
(Supplementary Fig. 2a): 12 upstroke frames and 10 downstroke frames. 
Since at these moments the speed and angle of attack and therefore drag 
are near the local maximum, the wing is under the  highest lateral loads 
and most deformed. 
In  lateral  view  three  points  can  be  identified  on  the  wing:  the  base 
(P1), the wingtip (P5) and the point on the border between the petiole and 
the membrane (P3). P3 was marked at the border that divides the wing into 
the  distal  part  (membrane  plus  bristles) and  the  proximal  part (petiole).  
We marked point P2 in the geometric middle of the petiole and point P4 in 
the geometric middle of the distal part (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). 
The  flexion  of  the  petiole  was  measured 
as  the  angle  λ1  between 
sections P1P2 and P1P3. The flexion of the distal part is the angle between 
P3P4  and  P3P5.  The  total  wing  flexion  is  the  angle  λ  between  P1P3  and 
P1P5.  The  deformation  range  of  the  wing  is  the  sum  of  the  average 
upstroke and downstroke λ.
a                                                                                     b
100 µm

The  deformation  range  of  the  distal  part  of  the  wing  is  7.6°;  the 
petiole    deforms    to    a    smaller    degree,    on    average    within    3.5° 
(Supplementary Table 1). The average deformation range of the wing is 
16.5°.  The  wing  has  an  S-shaped  profile  during  the  downstroke  and  a 
J-shaped profile during the upstroke (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Resolution 
did  not  allow  us  to  measure  deformations  of  the  bristles  separately, 
because the bases of the bristles could not be identified. But it was visible 
that  the  flexion  between  P4P5   was  less  than  between  P3P4,  so  the
deformation   of   the   bristles   was   smaller   than   deformations   of   the 
membranous part of the wing. 
Wing drag makes up most of the resulting aerodynamic force and is 
proportional to the projection of the wing onto the plane perpendicular to 
its instantaneous velocity. Because the area and velocity of the petiole are 
minor,   its   contribution   to   drag   can   be   neglected.   The   area   of   the 
projection and the drag of the rest of the wing depend on the flexion of
the distal part and are proportional to cosλ2, which varies within 1%  of 
the   estimated   resting   position.   Such   a   small   influence   on   the 
aerodynamics    allows    us    to    ignore    deformations    in    kinematics 
reconstructions and CFD calculations and use rigid wing models.

Section 5 – 3D reconstruction of kinematics 
The time courses of the Euler angles of the wings and elytra and body 
pitch angle of individual beetles PP2, PP4, PP5 and PP12 are shown in 
Extended Data Fig. 2a. There are minor differences between individuals. 
Vertical   and   horizontal   components   of   instantaneous   acceleration 
strongly  vary  depending  on  the  stage  of  the  cycle  (Extended  Data 
Fig. 2b). Vertical acceleration is synchronized with the time course of the 
lift force. 
The  wings  clap  dorsally  and  near-clap  ventrally.  During  the  ventral 
near-claps  after  downstroke,  the  minimal  distance  between  tips  of  the 
membranous parts of the wings of beetles PP2, PP3, PP5, PP6, PP8, PP10 
and  PP12  is 0.40  ±  0.23  body  lengths.  It  correlates  negatively  with  the 
vertical   component   of   the   instantaneous   body   velocity   (Spearman 
rs = −0.78,  p  <  0.05,  n  =  25).  It  can  be  assumed  that  with  increasing 
vertical  velocity,  viscous  drag  force  decreases  the  lift,  and  the  insect 
compensates this drag through more pronounced wing clapping.
Section 6 – On the similarity with rowing and breaststroke 
The  propulsive  mechanism  of  P.  placentis  may  be  compared  with 
rowing, as the term “power stroke” suggests: the insect wing and the oars 
of a boat alike produce useful thrust in short pulses, interlaced with the 
recovery phases. While this analogy is illustrative, it is important to mind 
its limitations. When the oar is submerged, it can impart a much greater 
momentum  than  when  it  is  in  air,  because  water  is  a  thousand  times 
denser  than  air.  Thus,  the  surrounding  medium  density  stratification  is 
exploited. By contrast, the wings of P. placentis vary in orientation and 
speed  to  generate  more  useful  force  during  power  stroke  than  parasite 
counter-acting  force  during  recovery.  But  the  resulting  variation  in  the 
momentum is not as dramatic as in the case of a boat.  
The P. placentis flight style shares more similarity with underwater 
breaststroke: the appendages extend during the power stroke to maximize 
the   drag   and   contract   during   the   recovery   stroke   to   minimize   it, 
respectively. The breaststroke gait is also used by  microorganisms such 
as the green algae Chlamydomonas. 
Another important difference is that the wings of P. placentis should 
generate a large enough aerodynamic force to support the body weight. 
Therefore,  the  wing  beat  frequency  is  relatively  high:  even  during  the 
slow forward flight as considered in the present study, the body velocity 
is  less  than  10%  of  the  maximum  velocity  at  the  geometric  radius  of 
gyration (Rg) during power stroke. The reported maximum flight speed11
of  0.31  m/s  is  less  than  50%  of  the  same  maximum  velocity  at  Rg. 
Therefore,  the  instant  center  of  rotation  of  the  wing  is  located  near  the 
hinge rather than near the wing apex. For a rowing boat, this would not be 
a typical operating regime. For microorganisms such as Chlamydomonas, 
it is typical12. 
Section 7 – Calculation of the geometric radius of gyration 
It  is  customary  to  define  dimensionless  aerodynamic  properties  of 
flapping  wings,  such  as  the  Reynolds  number,  with  reference  to  the 
geometric  radius  of  gyration  determined  from  the  second  moment  of 
area2,13. This is natural for membranous wings that generate aerodynamic 
forces  almost  exclusively  due  to  differential  pressure  at  the  surface, 
which  results  in  dynamical  similarity  scaling  with  the  projected  area  of 
the wing. For a bristled wing, however, about half of the normal force is 
due to the shear stress14 that depends on the total surface area. 
Considering that bristled wings function as leaky paddles producing 
between  66  and  96%  of  the  aerodynamic  drag  force  of  equivalent 
membranous wings14, it is reasonable to use the equivalent membranous 
wing  projection  for  calculating  the  radius  of  gyration.  This  approach 
results in dimensional numbers that are in concord with those known for

membranous  wings,  such  that  they  can  be  compared  directly  without 
amendment for the reference area difference. 
The  radius  of  gyration  Rg  in  the  present  study  was  calculated  as 
follows. Note that this is a geometrical quantity, i.e., it does not take into 
account   the   mass   distribution.   The   equivalent   membranous   wing 
projection on the xw-yw plane defines the set of points Ωw lying inside the 
wing  contour  (Supplementary  Fig.  4).  The  indicator  function  IΩw  is
sampled on a uniform grid covering a rectangular region of xw from -0.6R 
to 0.4R and yw from 0 to 1.1R with step 0.001R. This produces an array of 
values  equal  to  1  in  the  interior  of  the  contour  and  0  otherwise.  The 
geometric radius of gyration is evaluated as 
(1) 
The velocity at the radius of gyration is the velocity of a point on the 
longitudinal axis of the wing at the distance Rg from the hinge. The values 
shown in Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3 correspond to the magnitude 
of the velocity in the laboratory reference frame. 
Section 8 – Building 3D models for CFD 
The  insect  is  represented  in  our  3D  models  as  an  assembly  of  five 
rigid solid parts: two elytra, two wings, and a body. Supplementary Fig. 3 
shows the bristled model of the left wing. It is similar to the model used 
in  the  earlier  rotating  wing  simulations14.  The  main  difference  is  in  the 
out-of-plane  deviation,  which  is  substantial  in  the  proximal  part  of  the 
blade, according to the confocal microscope data. The distal part of the 
wing  is  essentially  planar.  The  wing  length  is  denoted  as  R.  In  the 
aerodynamic  calculation,  the  bristles  are  modelled  as  circular  cylinders 
with  diameter  b  =  0.00388R,  which  is  justified  by  the  prior  work14. 
The  central  blade  thickness  is  hb  =  0.008R  according  to  the  confocal 
microscope data. The right wing used in the simulations differs from the 
left wing by a small rotation of the bristles in the xw-yw plane around their 
respective  base  points, so  that  the bristle tips  deflect by  a  distance four 
times  as  large  as  the  bristle  diameter  b.  This  is  sufficient  to  prevent 
collision between the wings when they clap. 
Supplementary  Figure  3.  Orthographic  projection  view  of  the 
bristled wing model (left wing). Distances are scaled by the wing length 
R. a, View from the trailing edge side. b, Morphologically dorsal view. 
Supplementary  Fig.  4  shows  the  membranous  wing  model.  It  is 
constructed  by  sealing  the  gaps  between  the  bristles.  This  is  similar  to 
gluing  adhesive  tape  sheets  in  prior  experiments14.  To  simplify  the 
geometrical  processing,  the  membranous  wing  is  made  flat.  It  is  only 
used   in   conjunction   with   the   wing   kinematics   of   individual   PP2. 
The latter is such that the wings do not intersect when they clap. In the 
aerodynamic calculation, the wing thickness at any point is equal to the 
blade   thickness   hb.   This   enables   computing   with   the   minimum 
discretisation   step   Δxmin   twice   as   large   as   in   the   bristled   wing 
aerodynamic  simulations.  The  left  and  the  right  membranous  wings  are 
mirror images of each other.

membranous wing model. Distances are scaled by the wing length R. a, 
View from the trailing edge side. b, Morphologically dorsal view. 
The two elytra are also mirror images of each other. The volumetric 
models  are  based  on  confocal  microscope  data  (Supplementary  Fig.  5). 
However, the proximal part has been modified to avoid intersection with 
the body. For the elytra and for the wings alike, the centre of rotation is at 
the origin of the respective local coordinate system. The thickness in the 
aerodynamic calculation is uniform, he  = 0.008R. Note that the assumed 
uniform  thickness  of  the  elytra  and  the  wings  in  the  aerodynamic 
geometrical  models  described  here  is,  in  general,  different  from  the 
thickness in the inertia calculations.

elytron model. Distances are scaled by the wing length R. a, View from 
the trailing edge b, Morphologically dorsal view. 
The body model (Supplementary Fig. 6) is also based on information 
from  the  confocal  microscope,  and  it  is  stored  as  a  mesh  surface. Note 
that  it  is  not  perfectly  bilaterally  symmetric.  It  is  also  noteworthy  that, 
while the position of the hinge points in the  model closely  matches the 
attachment  location  of  the  wings  measured  from  SEM  images,  the 
position   of   the   elytron   hinges   has   been   slightly   offset   to   prevent 
intersection between the elytra and the wings as they undergo rigid solid 
body rotation.

Section 9 – Calculations of mass and moments of inertia for body, 
wing and elytron 
The second moment of inertia of the body about the pitching axis was 
calculated   in   Autodesk   Inventor   Professional   2019   (Autodesk   Inc., 
U.S.A.) using the CAD model of the body shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. 
The  surface  model  described  above,  after  geometric  simplification,  was 
“converted   to   base   feature”   of   Autodesk   Inventor   and   the   inertial 
properties   were   evaluated   assuming   uniform   density   distribution.   In 
combination   with   the   body   mass   scaling   formula,   we   obtained   the 
following  isometric  scaling  for  the  moment  of  inertia  in  kg·m2  as  a 
function of the body length in m: Jb = 2.14lb5. After appropriate rescaling,
we  obtained  the  principal  moments  of  inertia:  Jbxx  =  0.30·10−17  kg·m2
about  the  anterior-posterior  axis,  Jbyy  =  2.06·10−17  kg·m2  the  about  the
lateral axis and Jbzz = 2.15·10−17 kg·m2 about the dorsal-ventral axis. These
values  are  scaled  to  the  body  length  0.37  mm  and  mass  2.43  µg,  which 
correspond  to  individual  PP2  and  coincide  with  the  statistical  averages. 
Moments  of  inertia  of  individuals  PP4,  PP5  and  PP12  are  calculated  by 
rescaling the data for PP2 in proportion with the body length to the power 
of 5. 
The wing mass and moments of inertia were calculated by summing 
up  the  contributions  from  the  central  membranous  part  (blade)  and  the 
peripheral  setae  (bristles).  The  mass  of  the  blade  (0.0162  µg)  was 
evaluated as a product of the volume enclosed by the SEM surface model 
obtained  by  confocal  microscopy  stacking  (1.346·10−5  mm3)  and  the 
cuticle  density.  The  latter  was  taken  as  1200  kg/m3  in  all  calculations 
related to the wings and the elytra15. To calculate the mass of the setae, 
we  first  estimated  their  linear  density  (0.96  µg/m)  using  a  3D  model 
consisting of a short cylindrical segment and a few secondary outgrowth 
elements. The same model was used in our previous study14 to select the 
aerodynamically  equivalent  circular  cylinder  section.  The  mass  of  each 
seta  was  then  found  by  multiplying  its  length  by  the  linear  density. 
By summing up the  masses of all setae, we determined the  mass of the 
peripheral  bristled  part  of  the  wing  (0.0073  µg  for  PP2).  Thus,  the  full 
mass of a wing including the blade and the setae is 0.0235 µg for PP2. 
This  constitutes  0.97%  of  the  mass  of  the  body.  The  isometrically 
rescaled  values  for  PP4,  PP5  and  PP12  are  given  in  Supplementary 
Table 2. 
Subsequently,  we  calculated  the  moments  of  inertia  with  respect  to 
the  hinge  point  which  is  the  centre  of  solid  body  rotation  of  the  wing 
model  used  in  the  aerodynamic  simulations.  We  neglected  the  out-of-
plane  deviation  of  the  blade,  calculated  its  surface  density  as  mass 
divided  by  planar  projection  area  and  applied  a  simple  rectangular  2D 
quadrature  rule  with  a  discretization  step  of  50  µm.  The  moments  of 
inertia of the individual setae were calculated using the formula for a thin 
rod at an angle and the parallel axis theorem. The summation of the above 
contributions  yielded  the  following  values  for  the  non-zero  components 
of  the  bristled  wing  inertia  tensor  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Table  2. 
Note  that  the  direction  of  the  x-axis  is  from  the  trailing  edge  to  the 
leading edge,  y-axis is from the proximal part to the apex, the z-axis is 
complimentary  and  the  origin  of  the  coordinate  system  is  at  the  wing 
hinge (Supplementary Fig. 3).

We used the same method to evaluate the mass and the moments of 
inertia  of  a  hypothetical  wing  with  smooth  cylindrical  setae  having  an 
equivalent  circular  cylinder  section  (i.e.,  having  a  larger  diameter  and 
producing  the  same  aerodynamic  force  as  the  setae  with  secondary 
outgrowths). This diameter, b = 1.9 µm, is 2.1 times as large as the stem 
diameter of a real seta14. The full mass of a wing including the blade and 
the   aerodynamically   equivalent   cylindrical   setae   is  0.0421   µg.   The 
corresponding components of the inertia tensor are about twice as large as 
for the original wing (Supplementary Table 2). The mass and the moment 
of inertia of the equivalent membranous wing have been determined for 
three  different  assumed  values  of  membrane  thickness,  hm  =  0.73,  0.85 
and 1.12 µm, corresponding to the membranes of Trichogramma telengai 
(Hymenoptera:  Trichogrammatidae,  lb  =  0.45  mm),  Orthoperus  atomus 
(Coleoptera:   Corylophidae,   lb    =   0.8   mm)   and   Limnebius   atomus 
(Coleoptera:  Hydraenidae,  lb   =  1.1  mm),  respectively.  The  membrane 
thickness of 0.98 µm is the minimum thickness of the membranous part 
(blade) of a P. placentis wing. Membrane thickness values of the wings 
were obtained by measuring histological sections 0.5 µm thick made on a 
Leica  microtome  with  the  diamond  knife,  after  the  fixation  in  araldite. 
The  measurements  were  performed  on  an  Olympus  BX43  microscope. 
We  used  the  above-mentioned  2D  quadrature  rule  to  calculate  the  area 
enclosed by the outer contour of the blade and the line connecting the tips 
of the setae14, as well as the moments of area. After multiplying by  the 
membrane  thickness  and  the  cuticle  density,  we  found  the  equivalent 
membranous   wing   mass   values   and   moments   of   inertia   shown   in 
Supplementary Table 2. 
To evaluate the mass and the moments of inertia of the elytron, we 
used  the  same  method  as  for  the  central  membranous  part  of  the  wing. 
The  mass  was  estimated  using  a  3D  model  as  0.1740  µg.  Then,  the 
moments of inertia were obtained by 2D integration, neglecting the out-
of-plane deviation and assuming uniform thickness distribution, yielding 
the values given in Supplementary Table 2. 
Section 10 – Kinematic model for CFD 
The  wings  and  the  elytra  rotate  about  the  hinge  points  fixed  in  the 
body  reference  frame  (Supplementary  Fig.  6).  For  the  CFD  simulation, 
the  angles  ϕ,  θ  and  ψ  originally  measured  in  the  flight  experiment  are 
converted into the Euler angles compatible with the CFD solver16, relative 
to the anatomical stroke plane. We first calculated the Euler angles in the 
same  reference  frame  of  the  aerodynamic  stroke  plane  as  used  in  the 
definition of ϕ, θ and ψ: the positional angle is equal to ϕ, the elevation
angle  is  equal  to  θ,  but  the  feathering  angle  is  defined  as  the  rotation 
angle about the longitudinal axis of the wing, i.e., it is different from  ψ. 
Denoting the feathering angle as α, and the respective angle between the 
6 
wing plane and the stroke plane as ψ†(α), we used a genetic optimization 
algorithm  CMA-ES17  to  find  the  values  of  α  that  minimize  the  residue 
|ψ†(α) − ψ|  and  thus  define  the  same  wing  orientation  as  the  originally 
calculated  angle   ψ.  We  calculated  the  phase  average  and  left-right 
average values of α as described above.  
We then used the morphological model of the wing to define marker 
points. Each seta contains 100 points uniformly distributed along the axis 
between  its  root  and  its  tip.  A  total  of  600  points  are  placed  along  the 
blade midline. Knowing the Euler angles of the wings in the aerodynamic 
stroke plane reference frame and the distance between the hinge points, it 
is possible to determine the spatial position of the markers on the flapping 
wings.  We  stored  those  instantaneous  positions  at  201  time  instants 
between  t  =  0  and  t  =  T.  Subsequently,  we  evaluated  the  instantaneous 
orientation of the body at the same time instants using the mean value and 
the  first  Fourier  mode  of  the  body  angle  χ.  We  defined  the  anatomical 
stroke plane as the plane that moves with the body and coincides with the 
aerodynamic stroke plane when the body angle is equal to its mean value.  
The CFD simulation requires the Euler angles of the wing measured 
with respect to the anatomical stroke plane. Their values are found using 
optimization.    We    started    from    a    random    guess,    evaluated    the 
corresponding position of the markers on the wings in 3D, calculated the 
root-mean-square  distance  between  these  markers  and  those  determined 
earlier  in  the  aerodynamic  stroke  plane  reference  frame,  and  employed 
the CMA-ES to minimize that distance. The optimization was performed 
for  the  wings  and  for  the  elytra.  It  yielded  the  values  of  positional, 
elevation  and  feathering  angles  with  respect  to  the  anatomical  stroke 
plane that oscillates with the body. The values are available at 201 time 
instants  between  t  =  0  and  t  =  T.  To  evaluate  the  Euler  angles  at  any 
arbitrary time instant and ensure periodicity, we spline-interpolated on a 
uniform  grid  with  1024  points,  applied  the  fast  Fourier  transform,  and 
stored  the  first  M  =  11  modes  in  the  form  of  the  sine  and  cosine 
coefficients, as required by the CFD solver16. 
The  orientation  of  the  body  was  prescribed  by  defining  the  time 
evolution of the pitch angle between the horizontal plane in the laboratory 
reference frame and the longitudinal axis of the body xb. Note that in this 
study the body pitch angle is positive when the body is oriented nose up 
(this  is  opposite  to  the  sign  convention  used  previously16).  Fourier 
analysis  was  performed  and  only  the  mean,  the  first  sine  and  the  first 
cosine coefficients were retained.  
The anatomical stroke plane does not move with respect to the body. 
It is tilted by an angle η relative to the body transverse plane yb-zb, in the 
notation  of  Engels  et  al  (2015)16.  so  that  the  average  orientation  of  the 
anatomical  stroke  plane  coincides  with  the  orientation  of  the  original 
aerodynamic stroke plane16. 
Extended  Data  Fig.  2c  summarizes  the  time  evolution  of  the  Euler 
angles  of  the  wing  and  elytron  relative  to  the  body,  and  the  body  pitch 
angle,    for    four    individuals,    as    used    in    the    CFD    simulations. 
The anatomical stroke plane angle η takes the values −33.5, −36.6, −28.5 
and −35.8° for the four analyzed individuals, respectively. 
Section 11 – CFD simulation setup 
The computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed  using an 
open-source   Navier-Stokes   solver   WABBIT18.   It   was   based   on   the 
artificial   compressibility    method   to   enforce   the    velocity-pressure 
coupling, volume penalization method to  model the no-slip condition at 
the   solid   surfaces,   and   dynamic   grid   adaptation   using   the   wavelet 
coefficients  as  refinement  indicators.  The  morphology  and  kinematics 
described   above   define   the   time-varying   position   of   the   volume 
penalization  mask  function  and  the  internal  velocity  field  of  the  solid 
parts.  
The   computational   domain   is   a   12R   ×   12R   ×   12R   cube 
(Supplementary   Fig.   7),   where   R   is   the   wing   length.   The   volume 
penalization  is  used  in  combination  with  periodic  external  boundary 
conditions to enforce the desired far-field velocity18. The computational 
domain  is  decomposed  in  nested  Cartesian  blocks,  each  containing 
25 × 25 × 25   grid   points.   The   blocks   are   created,   removed   and 
redistributed  among  parallel  computation  processes  so  as  to  ensure  the 
maximum   refinement   level   near   the   solid   boundaries   and   constant 
wavelet   coefficient   thresholding   otherwise   during   the   simulations 
(Supplementary  Fig.  8).  Since  the  flow  is  far  from  being  turbulent  but 
Δxmin   is   small   for   geometrical   reasons,   the   threshold   value   for 
thresholding wavelet coefficients is fixed at ε = 10−2. With this choice, the 
most refined grid blocks are those that contain the solid surface.

grid used in the simulations. The grid is refined on the surface of the 
insect, including the setae, in order to resolve all features of the flow. 
The  numerical  simulations  started  from  the  quiescent  air  condition, 
continued for a time period of two wingbeat cycles with a coarse spatial 
grid resolution of Δxmin = 0.00781R to let the flow develop to its ultimate 
periodic state, then the spatial discretization size was allowed to reduce to 
Δxmin = 0.00098R if the wing was bristled or to Δxmin = 0.00195R if it was 
membranous, and the simulation continued for one more wing beat period

to  obtain  high-resolution  results.  The  air  temperature  was  25  °C  in  all 
cases, air density ρ = 1.197 kg/m3, and the kinematic viscosity of the air
ν = 1.54·10−5 m2/s. 
All numerical simulations were performed with the artificial speed of 
sound prescribed as c0 = 30.38fR. This value had been selected based on 
the  preparatory  comparison  between  CFD  simulations  and  dynamically 
scaled  rotating  wing  model  experiments14.  The  values  assigned  to  the 
volume   penalization   parameter   varied   in   proportion   with   Δxmin2/ν.
The    high-resolution    results    were    obtained    with    Cη = 6.48·10−7f, 
7.50·10−7f, 7.29·10−7f or 6.66·10−7f, depending on the individual number 
PP2, PP4, PP5 or PP12, respectively.  
The  low  Reynolds  number  of  the  flow  requires  that  the  step  of 
explicit  time  integration  be  proportional  to  Δxmin2.  This  constraint  is
handled  by  using  the  Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev  time-stepping  schemes19 
with large stability regions designed so as to encompass all eigenvalues 
of  the  linear  part  of  the  differential  operator  in  each  of  the  four  cases. 
These schemes are second-order accurate, and the number of stages s is 
relatively large to guarantee the desired stability: s = 22, 20, 21 or 22 for 
the individuals PP2, PP4, PP5 or PP12, respectively. 
Section 12 – Details of the flow around the setae 
During  the  dorsal  recovery  stroke,  the  wings  are  brought  closely 
together  (Extended  Data  Fig.  3,  t  =  2.0).  The  flow  velocity  field  is 
dominated by the downwash of the preceding power stroke. As the wings 
approach, they eject the air between them which results in an increased 
pressure. In the following power stroke (Extended Data Fig. 3, t = 2.37), 
the wings move downward at a high angle of attack. Even though the gap 
distance between the setae is rather large, the wings are seen to behave as 
if they were solid, with little fluid leaking between the setae. The pressure 
on the bottom surface is increased, while it decreases on the top surface 
of the wing. The flow exhibits the typical features of flapping flight, even 
though  the  leading  edge  vortex  is,  due  to  the  elevated  viscosity,  much 
weaker   compared   to   larger   animals.   The   ventral   recovery   stroke 
(Extended Data Fig. 3, t = 2.60) is similar to the dorsal one. We show the 
moment  when  the  wings  start  to  open,  which  results  in  an  increased 
pressure   on   the   outside.   Finally,   during   the   second   power   stroke 
(Extended  Data  Fig.  3,  t  =  2.82),  the  flow  is  again  similar  to  the  first 
power stroke. 
At all time instances, small, localized flow features are observed in 
the  direct  vicinity  of  the  bristles,  along  with  the  more  global  flow 
features.

Section 13 – CFD results 
The time evolution of the aerodynamic force acting on the beetle is 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 4a. In all cases, the vertical force has two 
positive  peaks  during  the  power  strokes,  and  it  is  negative  during  the 
recovery strokes. The  horizontal force also peaks during the two power 
strokes, but the sign changes from negative to positive. The mean vertical 
force  is  positive.  The  calculated  value  is  large  enough  to  support  the 
weight of the insect, with the small discrepancy which is partly due to the 
non-zero vertical acceleration of the beetle in the experiment, and partly 
due to modelling error. The mean horizontal force is small. These mean 
values are shown in Supplementary Table 3. 
Newton’s  second  law  provides  a  useful  relation  for  diagnosing  the 
accuracy of the aerodynamic force computation. Supplementary Table 3 
shows  the  two  components  of  the  residual  error  in  the  law  of  motion 
evaluated  after  substituting  the  computed  mean  force  and  the  measured 
acceleration, 
        ̅        ̅            ,                                  (2)
        ̅         ̅                  .                             (3) 
The  r.m.s.  values  of  ex  and  ez  across  the  four  individuals  are, 
respectively, 9.4% and 12.1%. Note that this error includes the inaccuracy 
of the CFD modelling and the uncertainty of the body mass evaluation. 
The  contribution  of  the  wings,  the  elytra  and  the  body  to  the  total 
vertical aerodynamic force is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4b. The main 
contribution  is  always  from  the  wings.  The  elytra  produce  a  noticeable 
positive vertical force towards the end of the morphological downstroke, 
but this force cancels out with the negative force generated later. 
The lift-drag decomposition of the vertical aerodynamic drag shows 
substantial    inter-individual    variability    (Extended    Data    Fig.    4c).  
The  instantaneous  force  is  always  dominated  by  the  drag,  but  its  large 
positive  and  negative  contributions  cancel  each  other  out  after  time 
averaging. Instead, the vertical aerodynamic force due to lift is for most 
of the time positive. Therefore, the mean vertical aerodynamic force is up 
to 68%, 84%, 79% and 40% due to the lift and 32%, 16%, 21% and 60% 
due to the drag for the four beetles, respectively.

The  wing  tip  trajectories  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  9,  coloured 
according  to  the  sign  of  the  vertical  aerodynamic  force  of  the  wings, 
emphasize that the wing beat cycle consists of two power strokes and two 
recovery  strokes.  During  the  power  strokes,  the  wings  produce  a  large 
aerodynamic force that has an upward component (e.g., at t/T = 0.29 and 
0.82).  The  wing  velocity  at  the  same  time  is  downward,  because  it  is 
tangential to the trajectory and the wing elevation angle decreases during 
the power stroke. Therefore, large portion of the aerodynamic force can be 
explained  by  the  drag.  However,  at  t/T  =  0.29  for  example,  the  vector 
diagrams show that the force is not perfectly anti-aligned with the velocity. 
It   is   deflected   upwards.   This   deflection   can   be   explained   by   the 
aerodynamic lift which is perpendicular to the direction of wing  motion. 
This positive deflection is present even during the recovery stroke, e.g., at 
t/T  =  0.19,  for  PP2,  PP5  and  PP12.  when  the  aerodynamic  force  is
downward. During the recovery strokes, the wings clap or near-clap and 
move  upwards.  This  motion  generates  a  downward  aerodynamic  force. 
The recovery motion is slow; therefore the aerodynamic force is small in 
magnitude,  but  it  acts  for  a  longer  time.  Hence,  the  net  time-average 
vertical aerodynamic force is an order of magnitude smaller than the peak 
at the power stroke.

vectors (magenta arrows) and wing orientation (yellow circles and arrows). Click to view interactive 3D models. a, PP2. b, PP4. c, PP5. d, PP12. 
The  body-mass-specific  mechanical  power  shown  in  Extended  Data 
Fig.  6  in  all  cases  peaks  during  the  power  strokes.  The  aerodynamic 
contribution is dominant. The largest peak is for PP5 (164.2 W/kg) and the 
smallest peak is for PP12 (90.4 W/kg). The mechanical power essentially 
remains   positive   through   the   entire   wingbeat   cycle   period,   although 
occasionally     it     takes     small     negative     values.     For     example, 
its  minimum  value  for  PP2  is  −5.5  W/kg  at  t/T  =  0.9  and  for  PP5  it  is  
−8.3 W/kg at t/T = 0.52. Therefore, this type of wing beat motion does not 
require  any  substantial  elastic  energy  storage.  The  mean  body-mass-
specific mechanical power is equal to 27.6, 29.5, 34.0 and 24.4 for PP2, 
PP4, PP5 and PP12, respectively. 
10 
The  aerodynamic  pitching  moment  that  the  wings  exert  on  the  body 
(Extended Data Fig. 7) is consistently negative (nose-up) during the first 
recovery and power strokes (approximately, morphological downstroke). It 
becomes  positive  (nose-down)  during  the  second  recovery  and  power 
strokes  (approximately,  morphological  upstroke).  The  inertial  pitching 
moment  due  to  the  elytra  changes  from  positive  to  negative  at  about 
t/T = 0.4 when the elytra begin to close to compensate for that changing 
direction of the aerodynamic pitching moment. The aerodynamic pitching 
moment  of  the  elytra  and  the  inertial  pitching  moment  of  the  wings  are 
small. 
Section 14 – Mechanical power calculation 
The mechanical power expenditure was evaluated using a previously 
described method of computational fluid dynamics16. Let us recapitulate it.
The mathematical model approximates the wings, elytra and body at rigid 
solid  objects  connected  by  spherical  joints.  The  internal  structure  of  the 
animal   is   not   modelled:   instead,   the   skeletal   and   muscle   action   is 
substituted, regardless of its physiological type, by actuation torques  
 ⃗⃗      ,                                                            (4) 
where the subscript j stands for the joint number and takes the values of  
1, 2, 3 and 4 for the left wing, right wing, left elytron and right elytron, 
respectively. The mechanical power expended on the actuation of the j-th 
joint is equal to  
      ⃗ ⃗     ⃗⃗      ,                                                    (5) 
where  ⃗ ⃗   is  the  angular  velocity  of  the  j-th  part  relative  to  the  body.
The  total  mechanical  power  P  of  the  insect  is  obtained  by  summation. 
The actuation torque applied on the  j-th part at the hinge is balanced by 
the aerodynamic and the inertia torques about the hinge point, 
 ⃗⃗            ( ⃗⃗          ⃗⃗       ).                                      (6) 
This suggests the following decomposition of the total mechanical power 
into the aerodynamic and the inertial components, 
                   ,                                                   (7) 
where 
           ∑    ⃗ ⃗     ⃗⃗      ,             ∑    ⃗ ⃗     ⃗⃗       .                 (8) 
Calculation  of  the  aerodynamic  torques  is  implemented  as  volume 
integration of the penalization term in the penalized momentum equation 
in the fluid solver16. This is equivalent to the more commonly used surface 
integration of fluid stresses.  
The inertial torque is equal to 
 ⃗⃗             (      ⃗ ⃗̇  ⃗ ⃗       ⃗ ⃗ ),                                       (9) 
where  Jj  is  the  tensor  of  inertia.  It  is  convenient  to  evaluate  the  above 
formula in the local coordinate frames of the respective wing/elytron, see 
Supplementary  Figs.  3,  4,  5  and  Extended  Data  Fig.  2a.  The  tensor  of 
inertia is symmetric and, in the thin plate approximation, it contains only 
four non-zero entries: Jxx, Jyy, Jzz and Jxy. They were calculated as described 
in the dedicated section of this document.  
Section 15 – The effect of elytra on body pitch oscillation 
To  estimate  the  effect  of  elytra  on  the  body  pitch  oscillation,  let  us 
consider the angular momentum conservation about the body pitch axis, 
                                                               (10) 
  
where  M  =  Mba  +  Mwi  +  Mwa  +  Mei  +  Mea,  Mba  is  the  body  aerodynamic 
pitching moment, Mwi, Mwa are the inertial and aerodynamic components 
of  the  pitching  moment  due  to  the  flapping  wings  and  Mei,  Mea  are  the 
inertial  and  aerodynamic  components  of  the  pitching  moment  due  to  the 
elytra,  respectively.  Note  that  the  “−”  sign  appears  in  (10)  because  the 
positive direction of χ is nose-up (we follow the aeronautical convention) 
but  the  positive  pitching  moment  direction  is  nose-down  to  be  consisted 
with  the  right-handed  coordinates  used  in  the  analysis.  Restricting  our 
attention to time-periodic solutions of (10) with the period T, we solve it 
using the Fourier transform, 
     ̂   ̂                                                     (11) 
where the hat denotes the Fourier transform of the temporal evolution of a 
quantity. In the practical calculation, we use the fast Fourier transform in 
MATLAB (MathWorks, U.S.A.). The time evolution M(t) is sampled on a 
uniform  grid  containing  N  =  1024  points,  k  takes  integer  values  from 
−N/2+1 to N/2, and we find  
 ̂     { ̂                                                          (12) 
                                    
Then,  the  inverse  fast  Fourier  transform  is  applied  to  calculate  χ(t) 
samples on the same uniform grid of points between 0 and T. We mainly 
want to know the amplitude Δχ =  max(χ)  −  min(χ). 
To avoid additional CFD simulation that would require full fluid-solid 
coupling, we neglect the dependency of Mba, Mwa and Mia on the difference 
between χ(t) prescribed in the original CFD simulation and that computed 
by solving (10). This is justified because the amplitude of the wing motion 
is much greater than the amplitude of the body motion, and the body and 
the  elytron  aerodynamic  pitching  moments  are  negligible.  The  values  of 
Δχ  obtained  from  (10)  with  Mba,  Mwi,  Mwa,  Mei  and  Mea  taken  from  the 
CFD  simulations  agree  well  with  Δχ  measured  in  the  experiment,  see 
Supplementary Table 3. This additionally validates the CFD model. 
Extended Data Fig. 7 further demonstrates that Mea is negligible. But 
the inertial pitching moment due to the elytra Mei is essential. If we fully 
neglect it, substituting M = Mba + Mwi + Mwa into (10), we find values of Δχ 
that are 1.9 to 2.7 times larger than in the previous cases with the elytra. 
The maximum body pitching angle max(χ) becomes greater than 90°. We 
therefore  conclude  that  the  elytra  act  as  inertial  brakes  that  prevent 
overturning.  
Section 16 – Numerical convergence 
Additional numerical simulations have been carried out to evaluate the 
accuracy of the CFD simulations. In addition to the original simulation of 
PP2  with  the  maximum  number  of  refinement  levels  jmax   =   9,  we  have 
repeated similar computations with jmax  = 8 and jmax  = 7. These new runs 
have a coarser grid resolution in the neighbourhood of the solid boundaries 
(see the values of Δxmin/R in Supplementary Table 4).

Extended  Data  Fig.  8  shows  the  time  variation  of  the  aerodynamic

three computations. All three show similar qualitative trends. The results 
for  jmax   =  8  and  jmax   =  9  are  close  enough  for  making  quantitative 
conclusions.   Thus,   the   difference   between   the   mean   vertical   force 
computed  with  jmax  =  8  and  with  jmax  =  9  is  less  than  9%  of  the  body 
11 
weight. The horizontal force difference is less than 1% of the body weight. 
The mean aerodynamic power differs by less than 4%.  
Section 17 – On the fluid-dynamic added mass effect 
It  is  common  to  use  the  concept  of  added  mass  to  describe  the 
acceleration  reaction  of  a  solid  body  moving  in  a  fluid.  An  order-of-
magnitude estimate can be obtained by the following formula20: 
M                           ⁄   ⁄                              (13) 
 
M is the added mass, ρ is the air density (1.197 kg/m3) and S is the wing 
area.  Assuming  the  added  air  mass  of  the  bristled  wing  (for  its  low 
leakiness)  is  about  the  same  as  the  added  air  mass  of  the  membranous 
wing  model,  we  find  M  =  0.0233  µg,  which  is  close  to  the  mass  of  the 
bristled  wing.  We  do  not  elaborate  further  on  this  question,  because  the 
acceleration  reaction  at  Re     10 strongly  depends  on  the  flow  velocity, 
which undermines the practicality of the added mass concept. 
Section 18 – Comparison with larger beetles and tiny insects of other 
orders 
The large 85° amplitude of the wing's deviation angle (Fig. 2b, d) 
is  in  striking  contrast  to  most  larger  beetles  (e.g.,  9  in  Trypoxylus 
dichotomus  (Linnaeus,  1771)21  and  16  in  Batocera  rufomaculata    (De 
Geer,  1775)22).  Small  stroke  deviation  angles  are  typical  of  lift-based 
hovering   flight   during   which   wings   move   within   a   stroke   plane 
perpendicular   to   the   direction   of   the   net   aerodynamic   force.   Large 
deviation  angles,  by  contrast,  are  typical  for  drag-based  flight  and  have 
been observed in different families of small wasps, midges and thrips23,24. 
Nevertheless, the fast power strokes and slow recovery strokes found in P. 
placentis are unique. The time course of vertical aerodynamic force with 
two narrow positive peaks and two shallow negative valleys has more in 
common with smaller representatives of other families23,24 than with larger 
beetles21    (Extended   Data   Fig.   9a).   This   also   includes   the   elevated 
instantaneous  reaction  loads  exerted  on  the  skeletomuscular  system.  Our 
calculations suggest that ptiloptery is an efficient solution to the problem 
of  reducing  the  inertial  component  of  those  peak  loads.  Ptiloptery  thus 
allows  P.  placentis  to  increase  wing  size  in  order  to  compensate  for 
gravity without increasing inertial costs during wing flapping. This might 
explain why pliliids tend to have larger wings relative to their body length 
than  other  Staphylinoidea1,25,26,27   (Extended  Data  Fig.  9b,  two-samples 
Wilcoxon test p = 0.000143). 
Let us elaborate on the comparison with  E. formosa Gahan, 1924 24.  
It  has  the  wing  length  R  =  0.61  mm,  wing  area  S  =  0.14  mm2,  flapping 
frequency  f  =  361  Hz  and  amplitude  Φ  =  144°  (the  data  corresponds  to 
individual  EF124).  Its  body  mass  can  be  estimated  as   mb   =  20  µg,
considering   weight   support  in   hovering   flight24.   In   comparison  with  
P.  placentis  individual  PP2,  the  body  mass  is  8  times  as  large  (which 
suggest that the body is probably about twice as long), but the wing is only 
24%   longer.   The   flapping   amplitude   is   20%   less,   but   the   flapping 
frequency is twice as high. 
The   aerodynamic   power   has   been   computed   in   the   reference24. 
The  inertial  power  can  be  estimated  using  the  same  method  as  for  
P. placentis. To this end, we used the available wing kinematics24 in terms 
of   Euler   angles,   and   a   rough   estimate   of   the   wing   inertia   tensor.  
We   estimated   the   wing   mass   using   the   allometric   trend   (SI   3)   as  
mw = 2.17Smm1.42 = 0.13 µg, where Smm is the wing area in mm2. Moments
of  inertia can  be  estimated  using  a  functional relation  J  =  const  ⋅  mw  R2
known  from  the  previous  work  on  Diptera7,  but  with  the  dimensionless 
constant  fitted  to  Hymenoptera  data10.  We  obtain  Jxx   =  9390  µg∙µm2,
Jyy = 308 µg∙µm2,  Jzz  =  9700  µg∙µm2,  Jxy  =  −219  µg∙µm2.  This  estimate
assumes  similarity  with  the  spanwise  and  chordwise  dimensionless  mass 
distribution of E. formosa and B. ingitus. This is plausible, since most of 
the   mass   in   an   E.   formosa   wing   belongs   to   the   relatively   large 
membranous  part  and  the  leading-edge   vein.   The  long  setae  in  the 
proximal part make little contribution, and  in the distal part the setae are 
short. 
The results for the body mass specific mechanical power as a function 
of  time  are  shown  in  Extended  Data  Fig.  10a.  During  power  strokes, 
E. formosa produces peaks of the inertial power that are 50% as large as 
the concomitant peaks of the aerodynamic power. Consequently, the peak 
total  power  is  greater  for  E.  formosa  than  for  P.  placentis  by  50%,
although  the  mean  body  mass  specific  mechanical  power  expenditure  is 
nominally equal in the two individuals of the two species (24 W/kg in E. 
formosa,  assuming  perfect  elastic  storage,  vs  28  W/kg  in  P.  placentis) 
(Extended Data Fig. 10b). 
The volume of the flight muscles of five specimens was measured on 
confocal  stacks  in  Bitplane  Imaris.  Samples  were  prepared  in  the  same 
way as for  measuring body  volume, with additional staining with 0.05% 
Rhodamin  B  buffer  solution  after  depigmentation  for  7  days  at  4  °C. 
The total  volume  of the  muscles involved in the  raising and lowering of 
the wing28 is 0.158 ± 0.003 nL3  (5.6% of the body volume). Considering 
the  muscle density  value as 1060 kg/m3, the total flight muscles  mass is 
6.9%  of  the  body  mass. Based  on  aerodynamic  power  and  flight  muscle 
mass,  the  mass-specific power  of  P.  placentis  muscles  is 350  W/kg  at  a 
frequency  of  171  Hz,  which  coincides  with  the  specific  power  output  of 
asynchronous  muscles  predicted  by  Pennycuick  &  Rezende  and  adopted 
by Ellington29. 
Section 19 – Ptiloptery and the original flying style help beetles to fly 
faster 
Let us put together four important observations. 
(I) We have found that bristled wings are lighter than the equivalent 
membranous wings and have smaller moments of inertia. 
(II) The inertial forces are proportional to acceleration, i.e., to flapping 
frequency squared. The inertial power therefore varies as frequency cubed. 
(III)  Since  the  Reynolds  number  is  relatively  low,  the  aerodynamic 
force  of  a  wing  is  proportional  to  its  velocity  raised  to  some  exponent 
   <   2.   The   velocity   is   proportional   to   the   flapping   frequency. 
The  instantaneous  aerodynamic  power,  defined  as a product  of the  force 
and  velocity,  is  proportional  to  the  frequency  raised  to  the  exponent  of 
1 +    <  3. 
  (IV)  The  wings  clap  dorsally  and  ventrally  even  at  low  speeds.  At 
high speeds, unable to further increase the flapping amplitude, the beetle 
unavoidably   increases   the   flapping   frequency    to   produce   enough 
aerodynamic   thrust   to   counter   the   body   drag,   keeping   the   flapping 
amplitude constant. Consequently, the peaks of the inertial power increase, 
and they do so faster than the aerodynamic power. However, the flapping 
frequency cannot be increased beyond the point when the muscles become 
unable to sufficiently accelerate the wing upon power stroke, even if the 
mean aerodynamic power is low. 
We  arrive  at  the  following  conclusion:  for  a  beetle  as  miniature  as 
P. placentis, with the cycle-averaged Re as low as 9, low wing moment of 
inertia is a prerequisite of fast flight. This is achieved by ptiloptery.
